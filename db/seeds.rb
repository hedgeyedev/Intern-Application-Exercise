	content: "SAN FRANCISCO — Google gave Andy Rubin, the creator of Android mobile software, a hero’s 
	farewell when he left the company in October 2014. “I want to wish Andy all the best with what’s next,”
	 Larry Page, Google’s chief executive then, said in a public statement. “With Android he created 
	 something truly remarkable — with a billion-plus happy users.” What Google did not make public was 
	 that an employee had accused Mr. Rubin of sexual misconduct. The woman, with whom Mr. Rubin had been 
	 having an extramarital relationship, said he coerced her into performing oral sex in a hotel room in 
	 2013, according to two company executives with knowledge of the episode. Google investigated and 
	 concluded her claim was credible, said the people, who spoke on the condition that they not be named, 
	 citing confidentiality agreements. Mr. Rubin was notified, they said, and Mr. Page asked for his 
	 resignation.
	 Google could have fired Mr. Rubin and paid him little to nothing on the way out. Instead, the company 
	 handed him a $90 million exit package, paid in installments of about $2 million a month for four years, 
	 said two people with knowledge of the terms. The last payment is scheduled for next month."

	title: "A.I. Is Helping Scientists Predict When and Where the Next Big Earthquake Will Be",
	content: "SAN FRANCISCO — Countless dollars and entire scientific careers have been dedicated to 
	predicting where and when the next big earthquake will strike. But unlike weather forecasting, which 
	has significantly improved with the use of better satellites and more powerful mathematical models, 
	earthquake prediction has been marred by repeated failure.
	Some of the world’s most destructive earthquakes — China in 2008, Haiti in 2010 and Japan in 2011, 
	among them — occurred in areas that seismic hazard maps had deemed relatively safe. The last large 
	earthquake to strike Los Angeles, Northridge in 1994, occurred on a fault that did not appear on 
	seismic maps.
	Now, with the help of artificial intelligence, a growing number of scientists say changes in the way 
	they can analyze massive amounts of seismic data can help them better understand earthquakes, 
	anticipate how they will behave, and provide quicker and more accurate early warnings.

	“I am actually hopeful for the first time in my career that we will make progress on this problem,” 
	said 
	Paul Johnson, a fellow at the Los Alamos National Laboratory who is among those at the forefront of 
	this research."

	title: "Facebook Removes Iranian Network That Was Spreading Disinformation",
	content: "SAN FRANCISCO — Last year, when Facebook disclosed a sweeping, coordinated disinformation 
	campaign carried out by Russian agents, the company presented the first evidence of a new kind of 
	information warfare.
	Now mischief makers in other countries appear to be following the Russian playbook.
	Facebook said on Friday that it had identified and removed a new influence network that had originated 
	in Iran. It was the second time this year that a disinformation effort targeting people in the United 
	States and Britain had been tied to Iranians.
	The company took down more than 82 pages, groups and accounts, including 30 Facebook pages, 33 
	Instagram accounts and three Facebook groups, it said. About one million users in the United States 
	and Britain followed those accounts.
	The latest disinformation campaign, which Facebook said was discovered last week, was much smaller 
	than the Russia-linked information operations before and after the 2016 presidential election. Back 
	then, millions of Facebook and Instagram users viewed divisive ads and disinformation that investigators 
	say were created with the aim of widening political and social divisions among Americans."
