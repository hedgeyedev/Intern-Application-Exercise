The existence of this letter may be evidently displaying it already, but I’m highly interested in Hedgeye developer summer internship. But everyone is smart and has “leadership, communication and interpersonal skills” right? Well, I believe that my ability to adapt and excel in a dynamic progressive environment is what truly sets me apart. I am all about learning. As I was doing the internship applciation exercise I had no idea about Ruby on Rails but I went through all the hurdle and figured it out. I also found a bug in the application exercise. There was some issues due to incompatible version of rails.
