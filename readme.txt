Readme:
For this I changed up several things. Firstly, I created comments. I allowed user to comment on the posts on the blog.
In order to view the comments, the view link has to be clicked. The edit link allows a person to edit the post. 
The delete link deletes the post. The comment link takes the user to the view page where, comments can be seen and comments can be left.
In order to test all of this, i created two posts. Besides functionality, the backround was changed and some stylistic elements were added to make the blog look nicer and mroe user friendly.
