internPost = Post.create(title: "BREAKING: Intern candidate working on Ruby on Rails blog.", content: "&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reports are flooding into the office this morning, babbling about an intern candidate who is working on a Ruby on Rails blog. Cam Pleet-Laer, one of our senior reporters, has it on good authority that the blog will feature a beautifully stylized user interface that is the result of over a decade of A/B testing. Other reports state that the blog will have the latest news, often fabricated by the blog’s owner. Some rumors have stated that the blog will simply contain Chuck Norris jokes and daily comics, but these are highly unlikely, due to the prestigious nature of the project. An anonymous source close to the project says that the first venture will be an investigative piece on the recent CIA files released by WikiLeaks, in collaboration with VICE. VICE has yet to respond to our inquiries, but that is of no surprise, considering the sensitive subject matter. This same source has stated that they are expecting an early April release date, which we will all be eagerly awaiting. Stay tuned for further updates.", imageSrc:"http://atulhost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ruby-on-rails.jpg")

Statistics released just this AM have shown a 1,000% increase in page visits to Vlad’s Blog, and new statistics predict that number hitting at least 1,000,000% by the end of the day.

resignsPost = Post.create(title: "Hedgeye CEO Keith McCullough Resigns Suddenly, Intern candidate named Interim Director", content: "&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A surprising turn of events unfolded this Sunday morning; it was announced that Keith McCullough, CEO of Hedgeye, has abruptly resigned, stating concerns over “future company direction” as his main motivator. An even more shocking blow fell hours later as reports of the Interim Director were released. It appears that a person known simply as, “Vlad”, has stepped in as Hedgeye’s Interim Director. Reports have stated that Vlad was previously being considered for an intern position, but due to some “glitch” in the system, has been promoted to the head of the company. HR, IT, and the NSA are all currently looking into the matter.\n<br>\n<b>UPDATE:</b> The exhaustive, 2 hour-long search has been called off by the Interim Director due to lack of results. Hedgeye has issued a public statement declaring that they do not believe any foul-play was involved. ", imageSrc: "http://i.imgur.com/Qjc5MOW.jpg")
