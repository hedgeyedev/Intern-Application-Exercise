So long as the beef is tender and the stew is stew-like, nobody is going to tell you that you made it wrong. But there are a few archetypes. My own childhood experiences with beef stew started with a can of Dinty Moore (with its oddly firm potatoes and carrots) and ended with a homemade version with chunks of dry, stringy beef floundering in a gravy-like broth flavored with tomato paste. I'm not naming names, but the cook's name started with M and rhymed with \"nom.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two things these versions of American beef stew, and indeed most versions have in common: they are simple, and they prioritize convenience over flavor.\r\n\r\nWell, I'm not going to settle for convenient. I want great. You know that scene in the movie where the nerdy hero or heroine finds inner confidence and suddenly becomes much more interesting and much more attractive to the rest of the world? That hero is beef stew and its time for confidence is now. The beef stew of my dreams starts with large, tender, juicy chunks of beef coated in a sauce that is rich and intense but not heavy or muddy (and that sauce had better be clean and glistening). It has vegetables that are more than just filler, bringing a complementary texture and flavor to the party.\r\n\r\nAfter dozens of pounds of stewed beef and scores of experiments, I've gotten a pretty good idea of techniques that can help perfect not just American beef stew, but will improve almost any beef stew recipe you've got. Here are my Beef Stew Rules.\r\nBeef Stew Rule #1: Select Your Meat Wisely\r\n\r\nThe first step in any beef stew is selecting the beef. Especially for a stew like this that doesn't rely on large quantities of wine or beer or other flavorings, the flavor of the beef is vitally important.\r\n\r\nThe muscles on a steer vary tremendously depending on what those muscles do during the animal's lifetime. Muscles that get very little exercise tend to be very tender but also quite bland (think: tenderloin). Muscles that do a lot of heavy lifting will be packed with flavor but also contain lots of connective tissue. This is exactly what you want in a stew, where the long gentle cooking will give that connective tissue a chance to break down and soften. But what's the best cut?\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\n\r\nHere's the scenario: You're at the supermarket and you see those chunks of already-cubed \"stew\" beef sitting in the butcher display or perhaps in a styrofoam tray in the cooler. You want to buy it. It'll save me time!, your brain says. I won't have to worry about cutting raw meat! The butcher must know what makes good stew meat, and he's already picked it for me!, it goes on.\r\n\r\nHere's my advice. Ask your mouth to politely but firmly tell your brain to be quiet—you are not going to listen to it. Buying pre-cut stew meat is a crapshoot at best. It's difficult to tell what part of the steer it came from, which means that it's difficult to tell how it's going to taste or what texture it's going to have. (That's assuming the stuff in the display is all from the same part of the steer in the first place, which it probably isn't.) Most of the time, that stew beef is also cut too small, especially if you use the searing technique I outline in the next section.\r\n\r\nSo what should you do? Buy your meat in large pieces so that you are certain you know where it's coming from. If I were going to pick one single cut that is economical, has great flavor, and a good ratio of fat to lean to connective tissue, it would be a boneless beef chuck roast, cut from the front shoulder of the steer. Of course, there are other great options as well. We have tasted our way through every viable stew cut in the market to figure out what the best is, so consult our guide for an expanded list of options and descriptions.\r\nBeef Stew Rule #2: Sear Your Beef Before Cubing\r\n\r\nOnce you've got your beef home, the next step in a stew is generally to sear that beef in a hot Dutch oven. We all know what happens when you try this: unless you've got an industrial strength stovetop, rather than searing, that beef ends up steaming for the first 10 to 15 minutes of cooking. This is bad news. Steam will suppress the temperature of the pan, preventing the meat from browning properly even as it continues to contract and express more moisture. The result is dry, overcooked beef in the finished stew. What's the solution?\r\n\r\nDon't cube the meat before searing.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\n\r\nI made three stews side by side: one made by searing a whole chuck roll, one where I first sliced the chuck roast into three steaks, and one made with beef I'd cubed. The whole chuck roast proved to be a little lacking in flavor (not as much surface area for good browning). The cubes, on the other hand, ended up taking a very long time to sear properly and produced a stew that was relatively dry and tough. Steaks offer a good balance between the two, so they're the way to go.\r\n\r\nBecause of their lower surface area, steaks brown in a fraction of the time of cubes (less surface area means fewer channels for escaping water which means less steam in the pot). Meanwhile, even though our beef isn't browned on every surface, there's still plenty of browned flavors to mix around the stewpot as it cooks.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\n\r\nOnce the steaks have been seared and rested, I cut them into relatively large pieces. 1 1/2 to 2 inches may seem big, but it helps the meat stay more moist and juicy (and by the time we're done with it you'll be able to cut it with a spoon anyway).\r\nBeef Stew Rule #3: Go Easy on the Flour\r\n\r\nWe've all had extra gloppy-style beef stew at high school cafeterias or perhaps straight out of a can borne of desperation. The culprit? Too much thickener. I've seen some recipes that call for as much as 3/4 of a cup of flour for a quart of liquid. That's more like beef paste than stew. Aside from texture, flour has another downside: it can dull flavors. I want my stew to be bright and bold, not muted and dull.\r\n\r\nI found that about 2 tablespoons of flour for 5 cups of starting liquid was about all my stew could handle before flavor started taking a hit. Tossing the flour with the beef after searing and cubing it was the easiest way to incorporate the thickener without creating lumps. The finished stew still wasn't quite as glossy and rich as I would have liked it to be, but I decided to move on to tackling other problems first.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\nBeef Stew Rule #4: Separate Your Vegetables\r\n\r\nThere's a delightful simplicity in the most basic stew recipes that have you add meat and vegetables to a pot, then slowly simmer them until everything melds together. But that method doesn't make for the best stew. Instead of intact pieces of meat and vegetables, you wind up with vegetables that have all but disintegrated, muddying up the broth and giving you nothing to break up the monotony of the meat.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this problem, I've started making my stews with two different batches of vegetables. One batch intended to be served with the stew and the other there simply to flavor the broth and meat as it cooks. For the vegetables served with the stew, I'm using quartered button mushrooms, chunks of carrots, potatoes, and pearl onion. Simply dumping them into the pot about an hour before it finishes cooking works fine, but it doesn't give the vegetables the kind of rich flavor I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nInstead, I sauté them first in the same pot that I used to brown the beef.\r\n\r\nI start by browning the mushrooms, letting them cook until they've really started to brown (this takes longer than most people have the patience for—at least 5 to 10 minutes, so give them time!), using a wooden spoon to scrape browned bits from the pot using the mushroom liquid as a solvent. Next I add the carrots and onions and allow them to brown as well. I transfer those vegetables to a plate and set them aside so that I can add them to the stew (along with the potatoes) later on.\r\n\r\nFor the stewing vegetables, I use a yellow onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and some herbs, keeping all the vegetables in as large pieces as possible in order to be able to easily fish them out later. I brown them in the same Dutch oven (be careful, the browned bits in the bottom of the pan may start to over-darken. Turn down the heat as necessary) before deglazing the pot with a cup of wine, which brings me to...\r\nBeef Stew Rule #5: Booze Makes it Better\r\n\r\nYou can skip the booze if you must, but wine, sherry, or vermouth really does add a dimension of flavor—acidity and complexity—that the simplest beef stews lack. You don't need much. A cup of wine will do, and you definitely don't need the pricey stuff. As we've shown in blind taste tests, that old advice to \"only cook with wine you'd drink\" simply doesn't hold water (or should I say wine?). So long as the wine is dry (that is to say, is not sweet) and has no aggressive off-flavors, you can use whatever wine you'd like.\r\n\r\nOnce I've selected my booze (I usually buy $7 bottles of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo for cooking), I add it to the pot, scraping up the significant amount of browned bits with my wooden spoon, then allowing the wine to reduce before adding my other liquid ingredients. (Reducing wine separately is a step you should take in most cases.)\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\nBeef Stew Rule #6: Use Chicken Stock, Not Beef\r\n\r\nWe're making beef stew, we oughta use beef stock, right? Not so fast. Unless you're making your own beef broth from beef bones, meat, and vegetables, I would highly recommend sticking with store-bought or homemade chicken stock. Canned or boxed beef stock is almost always inferior in flavor to boxed chicken stock with more flavor enhancing chemicals and less actual beef.\r\n\r\nI use low-sodium Swanson Organic chicken stock. You want to use a low-sodium stock because we're going to reduce it later on—a full-salt stock will get too salty. Chicken stock is fantastic because it's essentially a blank sauce, stew, or soup canvas. It picks up and enhances other flavors so well. Bolstered with the sautéed vegetables, browned beef, and aromatics, even chicken stock winds up with great, natural beef flavor. But it can still use a little bit of help.\r\nBeef Stew Rule #7: Break Out the Umami Bombs\r\n\r\nIf you read Serious Eats at all, you knew this was coming. Time to break out the umami bombs. I'm talking ingredients that are naturally rich in glutamic and inosinic acids—amino acids that trigger our sense of savoriness and make meaty things taste, well, meatier. There are plenty of umami bombs in the kitchen. Soy sauce, fish sauce, anchovies, Marmite, Parmesan cheese, and tomato paste are among them.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\n\r\nFor this stew, I went with a mixture of tomato paste (a classic American beef stew addition that also adds some body to the mix), Worcestershire sauce (another classic), anchovies, and soy sauce. Mixing three different umami bombs ensures that none of them dominates the flavor of the final dish, instead fading into the background to do their supporting work.\r\n\r\nTo incorporate the umami bombs, I started by first trying to mash them into a paste in a small bowl. This is a technique I used when working on a beef stew recipe for Cook's Illustrated a few years back (warning: paywall). It works okay, but it also leads to a slightly grainy stew broth. I was after smooth and glossy.\r\n\r\nI considered whether finessing the whole thing would work, using the over-the-top Thomas Keller technique of removing the cooked meat before passing the broth through a series of ever-finer meshes until it is perfectly clear. This is a great technique if you have tons of patience, a large number of strainers, and a personal dishwasher on retainer. Not practical for normal folks.\r\n\r\nI decided to go with the brute force method: the blender.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\n\r\nBy blending the tomato paste, Worcestershire, anchovies, and soy sauce directly into the broth, it comes out perfectly smooth with no need to strain.\r\nBeef Stew Rule #8: Don't Waste Flavor!\r\n\r\nYou know that plate of cubed beef we set aside earlier? Go and take a look at it now and tell me what you see. That liquid pooled under the meat is all flavor, one of the universe's most precious resources. Don't waste it.\r\n\r\nInto the pot it goes.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\nBeef Stew Rule #9: Powdered Gelatin FTW\r\n\r\nI had the beef and the flavor of the braising liquid tackled, now it was time to address texture. I'm okay with a pretty soupy broth for certain types of beef stew. Boeuf Bourguignon, for instance, with its chunks of bacon, doesn't need a thick gravy to help it stick to your ribs. American beef stew, on other hand, should at least be thick enough that it doesn't slosh around in a bowl.\r\n\r\nI was already at the limit of where I wanted to take my flour content, which meant that I had to turn towards alternative thickeners.\r\n\r\nCan you long-time readers guess what's coming next? You got it. Gelatin. We are just so darn predictable sometimes. If we pull out the gelatin frequently, it's because it works. The very best beef stews I've had in my life were made with veal stock, a stock that is rich with gelatin from calves. It's a common ingredient in restaurants, not so much in home kitchens.\r\n\r\nFortunately we have easy access to unflavored powdered gelatin. Unlike flour, gelatin thickens without dulling flavors or turning the broth muddy. Indeed, it has quite the opposite it effect: it thickens up the broth in a way that it coats your tongue, allowing you to taste it more easily. Gelatin does a good job of thickening liquids on their own, but it's even better at thickening broths that have a good amount of fat in them, helping that fat and the liquid underneath emulsify to create a sauce that is thicker than either component on its own.\r\n\r\nThese two batches of stew were made with identical ingredients other than the ounce of gelatin I added to the stew on the left.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\n\r\nThe difference in texture is significant, but it's also interesting to note that while the stew on the right looks greasy with pools of fat glistening on the surface of the broth, the one of the left has no distinct fat pockets—it's all been cleanly emulsified into the stew.\r\nBeef Stew Rule #10: Yukon Golds Make for Cleaner Stew\r\n\r\nWe're entering the home stretch here. Stick with me, though, because our stew gets better. What is American beef stew without potatoes? They bulk up the pot, are great at sopping up flavor, and break the monotony of the meat. Most stew recipes call for russets, the starchiest of the common potato varieties you'll find in the supermarket. Russets are great in classic recipes because they perform double duty, both giving you something to eat in the final bowl and also helping the broth thicken with the starch they give off.\r\n\r\nBut stews thickened with potato starch have the same problem as those thickened with too much flour: the starch can muddy the flavors.\r\n\r\nBecause I already have the stew texture exactly where I want it, I prefer to use Yukon gold potatoes, which have a more buttery flavor and don't release as much starch. Even waxy red potatoes or new potatoes would work here as well.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\nBeef Stew Rule #11: Use the Oven, Not the Stove (and Crack the Lid!)\r\n\r\nOK, so we've got our browned vegetables, our reduced booze, our gelatin- and umami bomb-enhanced stock, and our flour-coated beef in the pot. Let's add a couple bay leaves and thyme sprigs to there as well for good measure. Next question: Stovetop or oven? And does it make a difference? It does, and it comes down to the amount of energy being pumped into that pot and more importantly, which direction it's coming from.\r\n\r\nA stovetop is a constant energy output system. You set the burner to a certain level, and it maintains that level regardless of what's going on in the pot above it. An oven, on the other hand, is a constant temperature system. You set it to a given temperature and it uses as much or as little energy as it needs to get to that temperature and maintain it. A stovetop heats only from underneath. An oven heats from all directions.\r\n\r\nThe differences are subtle but can have a big impact on your finished stew. Ideally, a stew should be cooked at a very bare simmer. The more vigorously it bubbles, the dryer and tougher the meat will end up and the murkier the broth. 180 to 190°F (82 to 88°C) is the ideal range.\r\n\r\nWith the constant energy of the stovetop, it's very difficult to maintain this temperature. Put the lid on and even with the lowest heat setting you're going to wind up at a full 212°F (100°C) in that pot. Remove the lid to allow for some evaporation (thereby suppressing the maximum temperature—evaporation steals energy from the pot) and you run into a different problem. The stew is reducing but you're adding the same amount of energy to it, which means it will get hotter and hotter over the course of its 2 to 3 hour cook time. And of course, the hotter it gets, the faster it reduces, compounding this problem.\r\n\r\nFinally, because the heat is only coming from the bottom, no additional browning or flavor production is going to occur in the pot. What you start with is what you've got to work with. (This is one of the reasons why food cooked in a slow cooker tends to come out blander than food slow-cooked in an oven.)\r\n\r\nThe oven, on the other hand, handles all of these issues. First, because it's a constant temperature system, it doesn't matter how much stew you're cooking. You could cook 5 gallons or a pint—it'll still cook at the same temperature. This means that you can crack the lid of the pot to allow the stew to maintain a slightly lower cooking temperature and not be concerned that as it reduces it'll get too hot.\r\n\r\nWith heat coming from all directions, you'll also find that the stew will continue to brown as it simmers, forming a dark crust on top and around the edges of the pot. This is a good thing as it only adds more flavor. In fact, if you're really lazy, you can even skip the whole searing step and let the beef brown only in the oven. You don't get nearly as much flavor development, but it works.\r\n\r\nIt took some finagling to get the timing right, but I found that removing the large chunks of braising vegetables about an hour and a half into cooking gives them plenty of time to give up their flavor to the stew. Once I discard the spent vegetables, I add in my potatoes along with the carrots, pearl onions, and mushrooms I'd been holding off to the side.\r\nBeef Stew Rule #12: Don't Overcook It!\r\n\r\nThe last real rule to cooking beef stew is one that I've seen broken countless times (including by me back in those wild days when I'd stew with reckless abandon): don't overcook it. The idea of a stew simmering away all day sounds appealing. If 2 1/2 hours of simmering makes tender beef, shouldn't 6 or 8 hours make even more tender beef? Unfortunately it doesn't work that way.\r\n\r\nWhen stewing meat, you're playing a racing game between two simultaneous processes. First is the conversion of connective tissues to gelatin. This softens the meat and makes it taste moister. On the other hand, muscle proteins are constantly contracting and squeezing out internal moisture. This hardens the meat and makes it tougher.\r\n\r\nIdeally, by the time the connective tissue has softened (and this happens quite quickly and suddenly—your beef stays tough right up to the moment that it isn't), the muscles will still have allowed some natural juices to remain and you end up with soft, tender, juicy meat. Let it cook too long (or simmer too hard) and the muscles will have pressed out so much moisture that even the added lubrication of the broken down connective tissue can't help it.\r\n\r\nThe exact timing is dependent on exactly how your oven works and on the exact cut of meat you have, but with large chunks of beef in a 275°F (135°C) oven with the lid cracked, it takes around 2 1/2 hours to properly tenderize. I start poking my meat after about 2 1/4 hours and check in every so often until the meat is just on the brink of being tender enough to cut with a spoon (it'll continue cooking a little even after it comes out of the oven). By this stage, my added vegetables are also perfectly cooked and the broth has reduced into a shiny, rich sauce.\r\n\r\nAs I discovered through an informal Twitter survey, folks are divided on the subject of peas in stew. I'm in favor of them, but only if they are frozen peas added right at the end so they retain their bright green pop. You can do with them what you will.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J.

Fish out the thyme sprigs and bay leaves (or leave them in like my mom did), season the broth to taste (it probably won't need much more salt but will need more pepper), and serve it up.\r\n\r\nWait a minute. We've all heard that stews get better over the course of a few days, right? We put this to the test, and found there isn't much difference. And to be quite honest, I've always found that particular bit of advice to be more of a blessing than a directive. It's okay to have leftovers of this, since they will still taste great when reheated is what we're really saying. Because honestly, find me a person who can spend an afternoon in the kitchen with the smells of the beef stew filling the house who will then turn around and say, \"Welp, you're done. Into the fridge with you. What are we having for dinner tonight? Because that beef stew is for tomorrow!\"\r\n\r\nI mean, look at it. You can't see how that beef gives under the slightest pressure from the spoon or how the broth coats your tongue or how the carrots and potatoes pick up the flavor of the meat, but trust me, all that is going on and more.\r\n\r\nSo again: letting that stew rest overnight before you dig in? It just doesn't happen. Eat the stew straight away, save the leftovers, and eat it again later in the week.\r\n\r\nOr just eat the whole darn pot in one sitting.

So long as the beef is tender and the stew is stew-like, nobody is going to tell you that you made it wrong. But there are a few archetypes. My own childhood experiences with beef stew started with a can of Dinty Moore (with its oddly firm potatoes and carrots) and ended with a homemade version with chunks of dry, stringy beef floundering in a gravy-like broth flavored with tomato paste. I'm not naming names, but the cook's name started with M and rhymed with \"nom.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two things these versions of American beef stew, and indeed most versions have in common: they are simple, and they prioritize convenience over flavor.\r\n\r\nWell, I'm not going to settle for convenient. I want great. You know that scene in the movie where the nerdy hero or heroine finds inner confidence and suddenly becomes much more interesting and much more attractive to the rest of the world? That hero is beef stew and its time for confidence is now. The beef stew of my dreams starts with large, tender, juicy chunks of beef coated in a sauce that is rich and intense but not heavy or muddy (and that sauce had better be clean and glistening). It has vegetables that are more than just filler, bringing a complementary texture and flavor to the party.\r\n\r\nAfter dozens of pounds of stewed beef and scores of experiments, I've gotten a pretty good idea of techniques that can help perfect not just American beef stew, but will improve almost any beef stew recipe you've got. Here are my Beef Stew Rules.\r\nBeef Stew Rule #1: Select Your Meat Wisely\r\n\r\nThe first step in any beef stew is selecting the beef. Especially for a stew like this that doesn't rely on large quantities of wine or beer or other flavorings, the flavor of the beef is vitally important.\r\n\r\nThe muscles on a steer vary tremendously depending on what those muscles do during the animal's lifetime. Muscles that get very little exercise tend to be very tender but also quite bland (think: tenderloin). Muscles that do a lot of heavy lifting will be packed with flavor but also contain lots of connective tissue. This is exactly what you want in a stew, where the long gentle cooking will give that connective tissue a chance to break down and soften. But what's the best cut?\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\n\r\nHere's the scenario: You're at the supermarket and you see those chunks of already-cubed \"stew\" beef sitting in the butcher display or perhaps in a styrofoam tray in the cooler. You want to buy it. It'll save me time!, your brain says. I won't have to worry about cutting raw meat! The butcher must know what makes good stew meat, and he's already picked it for me!, it goes on.\r\n\r\nHere's my advice. Ask your mouth to politely but firmly tell your brain to be quiet—you are not going to listen to it. Buying pre-cut stew meat is a crapshoot at best. It's difficult to tell what part of the steer it came from, which means that it's difficult to tell how it's going to taste or what texture it's going to have. (That's assuming the stuff in the display is all from the same part of the steer in the first place, which it probably isn't.) Most of the time, that stew beef is also cut too small, especially if you use the searing technique I outline in the next section.\r\n\r\nSo what should you do? Buy your meat in large pieces so that you are certain you know where it's coming from. If I were going to pick one single cut that is economical, has great flavor, and a good ratio of fat to lean to connective tissue, it would be a boneless beef chuck roast, cut from the front shoulder of the steer. Of course, there are other great options as well. We have tasted our way through every viable stew cut in the market to figure out what the best is, so consult our guide for an expanded list of options and descriptions.\r\nBeef Stew Rule #2: Sear Your Beef Before Cubing\r\n\r\nOnce you've got your beef home, the next step in a stew is generally to sear that beef in a hot Dutch oven. We all know what happens when you try this: unless you've got an industrial strength stovetop, rather than searing, that beef ends up steaming for the first 10 to 15 minutes of cooking. This is bad news. Steam will suppress the temperature of the pan, preventing the meat from browning properly even as it continues to contract and express more moisture. The result is dry, overcooked beef in the finished stew. What's the solution?\r\n\r\nDon't cube the meat before searing.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\n\r\nI made three stews side by side: one made by searing a whole chuck roll, one where I first sliced the chuck roast into three steaks, and one made with beef I'd cubed. The whole chuck roast proved to be a little lacking in flavor (not as much surface area for good browning). The cubes, on the other hand, ended up taking a very long time to sear properly and produced a stew that was relatively dry and tough. Steaks offer a good balance between the two, so they're the way to go.\r\n\r\nBecause of their lower surface area, steaks brown in a fraction of the time of cubes (less surface area means fewer channels for escaping water which means less steam in the pot). Meanwhile, even though our beef isn't browned on every surface, there's still plenty of browned flavors to mix around the stewpot as it cooks.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\n\r\nOnce the steaks have been seared and rested, I cut them into relatively large pieces. 1 1/2 to 2 inches may seem big, but it helps the meat stay more moist and juicy (and by the time we're done with it you'll be able to cut it with a spoon anyway).\r\nBeef Stew Rule #3: Go Easy on the Flour\r\n\r\nWe've all had extra gloppy-style beef stew at high school cafeterias or perhaps straight out of a can borne of desperation. The culprit? Too much thickener. I've seen some recipes that call for as much as 3/4 of a cup of flour for a quart of liquid. That's more like beef paste than stew. Aside from texture, flour has another downside: it can dull flavors. I want my stew to be bright and bold, not muted and dull.\r\n\r\nI found that about 2 tablespoons of flour for 5 cups of starting liquid was about all my stew could handle before flavor started taking a hit. Tossing the flour with the beef after searing and cubing it was the easiest way to incorporate the thickener without creating lumps. The finished stew still wasn't quite as glossy and rich as I would have liked it to be, but I decided to move on to tackling other problems first.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\nBeef Stew Rule #4: Separate Your Vegetables\r\n\r\nThere's a delightful simplicity in the most basic stew recipes that have you add meat and vegetables to a pot, then slowly simmer them until everything melds together. But that method doesn't make for the best stew. Instead of intact pieces of meat and vegetables, you wind up with vegetables that have all but disintegrated, muddying up the broth and giving you nothing to break up the monotony of the meat.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this problem, I've started making my stews with two different batches of vegetables. One batch intended to be served with the stew and the other there simply to flavor the broth and meat as it cooks. For the vegetables served with the stew, I'm using quartered button mushrooms, chunks of carrots, potatoes, and pearl onion. Simply dumping them into the pot about an hour before it finishes cooking works fine, but it doesn't give the vegetables the kind of rich flavor I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nInstead, I sauté them first in the same pot that I used to brown the beef.\r\n\r\nI start by browning the mushrooms, letting them cook until they've really started to brown (this takes longer than most people have the patience for—at least 5 to 10 minutes, so give them time!), using a wooden spoon to scrape browned bits from the pot using the mushroom liquid as a solvent. Next I add the carrots and onions and allow them to brown as well. I transfer those vegetables to a plate and set them aside so that I can add them to the stew (along with the potatoes) later on.\r\n\r\nFor the stewing vegetables, I use a yellow onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and some herbs, keeping all the vegetables in as large pieces as possible in order to be able to easily fish them out later. I brown them in the same Dutch oven (be careful, the browned bits in the bottom of the pan may start to over-darken. Turn down the heat as necessary) before deglazing the pot with a cup of wine, which brings me to...\r\nBeef Stew Rule #5: Booze Makes it Better\r\n\r\nYou can skip the booze if you must, but wine, sherry, or vermouth really does add a dimension of flavor—acidity and complexity—that the simplest beef stews lack. You don't need much. A cup of wine will do, and you definitely don't need the pricey stuff. As we've shown in blind taste tests, that old advice to \"only cook with wine you'd drink\" simply doesn't hold water (or should I say wine?). So long as the wine is dry (that is to say, is not sweet) and has no aggressive off-flavors, you can use whatever wine you'd like.\r\n\r\nOnce I've selected my booze (I usually buy $7 bottles of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo for cooking), I add it to the pot, scraping up the significant amount of browned bits with my wooden spoon, then allowing the wine to reduce before adding my other liquid ingredients. (Reducing wine separately is a step you should take in most cases.)\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\nBeef Stew Rule #6: Use Chicken Stock, Not Beef\r\n\r\nWe're making beef stew, we oughta use beef stock, right? Not so fast. Unless you're making your own beef broth from beef bones, meat, and vegetables, I would highly recommend sticking with store-bought or homemade chicken stock. Canned or boxed beef stock is almost always inferior in flavor to boxed chicken stock with more flavor enhancing chemicals and less actual beef.\r\n\r\nI use low-sodium Swanson Organic chicken stock. You want to use a low-sodium stock because we're going to reduce it later on—a full-salt stock will get too salty. Chicken stock is fantastic because it's essentially a blank sauce, stew, or soup canvas. It picks up and enhances other flavors so well. Bolstered with the sautéed vegetables, browned beef, and aromatics, even chicken stock winds up with great, natural beef flavor. But it can still use a little bit of help.\r\nBeef Stew Rule #7: Break Out the Umami Bombs\r\n\r\nIf you read Serious Eats at all, you knew this was coming. Time to break out the umami bombs. I'm talking ingredients that are naturally rich in glutamic and inosinic acids—amino acids that trigger our sense of savoriness and make meaty things taste, well, meatier. There are plenty of umami bombs in the kitchen. Soy sauce, fish sauce, anchovies, Marmite, Parmesan cheese, and tomato paste are among them.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\n\r\nFor this stew, I went with a mixture of tomato paste (a classic American beef stew addition that also adds some body to the mix), Worcestershire sauce (another classic), anchovies, and soy sauce. Mixing three different umami bombs ensures that none of them dominates the flavor of the final dish, instead fading into the background to do their supporting work.\r\n\r\nTo incorporate the umami bombs, I started by first trying to mash them into a paste in a small bowl. This is a technique I used when working on a beef stew recipe for Cook's Illustrated a few years back (warning: paywall). It works okay, but it also leads to a slightly grainy stew broth. I was after smooth and glossy.\r\n\r\nI considered whether finessing the whole thing would work, using the over-the-top Thomas Keller technique of removing the cooked meat before passing the broth through a series of ever-finer meshes until it is perfectly clear. This is a great technique if you have tons of patience, a large number of strainers, and a personal dishwasher on retainer. Not practical for normal folks.\r\n\r\nI decided to go with the brute force method: the blender.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\n\r\nBy blending the tomato paste, Worcestershire, anchovies, and soy sauce directly into the broth, it comes out perfectly smooth with no need to strain.\r\nBeef Stew Rule #8: Don't Waste Flavor!\r\n\r\nYou know that plate of cubed beef we set aside earlier? Go and take a look at it now and tell me what you see. That liquid pooled under the meat is all flavor, one of the universe's most precious resources. Don't waste it.\r\n\r\nInto the pot it goes.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\nBeef Stew Rule #9: Powdered Gelatin FTW\r\n\r\nI had the beef and the flavor of the braising liquid tackled, now it was time to address texture. I'm okay with a pretty soupy broth for certain types of beef stew. Boeuf Bourguignon, for instance, with its chunks of bacon, doesn't need a thick gravy to help it stick to your ribs. American beef stew, on other hand, should at least be thick enough that it doesn't slosh around in a bowl.\r\n\r\nI was already at the limit of where I wanted to take my flour content, which meant that I had to turn towards alternative thickeners.\r\n\r\nCan you long-time readers guess what's coming next? You got it. Gelatin. We are just so darn predictable sometimes. If we pull out the gelatin frequently, it's because it works. The very best beef stews I've had in my life were made with veal stock, a stock that is rich with gelatin from calves. It's a common ingredient in restaurants, not so much in home kitchens.\r\n\r\nFortunately we have easy access to unflavored powdered gelatin. Unlike flour, gelatin thickens without dulling flavors or turning the broth muddy. Indeed, it has quite the opposite it effect: it thickens up the broth in a way that it coats your tongue, allowing you to taste it more easily. Gelatin does a good job of thickening liquids on their own, but it's even better at thickening broths that have a good amount of fat in them, helping that fat and the liquid underneath emulsify to create a sauce that is thicker than either component on its own.\r\n\r\nThese two batches of stew were made with identical ingredients other than the ounce of gelatin I added to the stew on the left.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\n\r\nThe difference in texture is significant, but it's also interesting to note that while the stew on the right looks greasy with pools of fat glistening on the surface of the broth, the one of the left has no distinct fat pockets—it's all been cleanly emulsified into the stew.\r\nBeef Stew Rule #10: Yukon Golds Make for Cleaner Stew\r\n\r\nWe're entering the home stretch here. Stick with me, though, because our stew gets better. What is American beef stew without potatoes? They bulk up the pot, are great at sopping up flavor, and break the monotony of the meat. Most stew recipes call for russets, the starchiest of the common potato varieties you'll find in the supermarket. Russets are great in classic recipes because they perform double duty, both giving you something to eat in the final bowl and also helping the broth thicken with the starch they give off.\r\n\r\nBut stews thickened with potato starch have the same problem as those thickened with too much flour: the starch can muddy the flavors.\r\n\r\nBecause I already have the stew texture exactly where I want it, I prefer to use Yukon gold potatoes, which have a more buttery flavor and don't release as much starch. Even waxy red potatoes or new potatoes would work here as well.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\nBeef Stew Rule #11: Use the Oven, Not the Stove (and Crack the Lid!)\r\n\r\nOK, so we've got our browned vegetables, our reduced booze, our gelatin- and umami bomb-enhanced stock, and our flour-coated beef in the pot. Let's add a couple bay leaves and thyme sprigs to there as well for good measure. Next question: Stovetop or oven? And does it make a difference? It does, and it comes down to the amount of energy being pumped into that pot and more importantly, which direction it's coming from.\r\n\r\nA stovetop is a constant energy output system. You set the burner to a certain level, and it maintains that level regardless of what's going on in the pot above it. An oven, on the other hand, is a constant temperature system. You set it to a given temperature and it uses as much or as little energy as it needs to get to that temperature and maintain it. A stovetop heats only from underneath. An oven heats from all directions.\r\n\r\nThe differences are subtle but can have a big impact on your finished stew. Ideally, a stew should be cooked at a very bare simmer. The more vigorously it bubbles, the dryer and tougher the meat will end up and the murkier the broth. 180 to 190°F (82 to 88°C) is the ideal range.\r\n\r\nWith the constant energy of the stovetop, it's very difficult to maintain this temperature. Put the lid on and even with the lowest heat setting you're going to wind up at a full 212°F (100°C) in that pot. Remove the lid to allow for some evaporation (thereby suppressing the maximum temperature—evaporation steals energy from the pot) and you run into a different problem. The stew is reducing but you're adding the same amount of energy to it, which means it will get hotter and hotter over the course of its 2 to 3 hour cook time. And of course, the hotter it gets, the faster it reduces, compounding this problem.\r\n\r\nFinally, because the heat is only coming from the bottom, no additional browning or flavor production is going to occur in the pot. What you start with is what you've got to work with. (This is one of the reasons why food cooked in a slow cooker tends to come out blander than food slow-cooked in an oven.)\r\n\r\nThe oven, on the other hand, handles all of these issues. First, because it's a constant temperature system, it doesn't matter how much stew you're cooking. You could cook 5 gallons or a pint—it'll still cook at the same temperature. This means that you can crack the lid of the pot to allow the stew to maintain a slightly lower cooking temperature and not be concerned that as it reduces it'll get too hot.\r\n\r\nWith heat coming from all directions, you'll also find that the stew will continue to brown as it simmers, forming a dark crust on top and around the edges of the pot. This is a good thing as it only adds more flavor. In fact, if you're really lazy, you can even skip the whole searing step and let the beef brown only in the oven. You don't get nearly as much flavor development, but it works.\r\n\r\nIt took some finagling to get the timing right, but I found that removing the large chunks of braising vegetables about an hour and a half into cooking gives them plenty of time to give up their flavor to the stew. Once I discard the spent vegetables, I add in my potatoes along with the carrots, pearl onions, and mushrooms I'd been holding off to the side.\r\nBeef Stew Rule #12: Don't Overcook It!\r\n\r\nThe last real rule to cooking beef stew is one that I've seen broken countless times (including by me back in those wild days when I'd stew with reckless abandon): don't overcook it. The idea of a stew simmering away all day sounds appealing. If 2 1/2 hours of simmering makes tender beef, shouldn't 6 or 8 hours make even more tender beef? Unfortunately it doesn't work that way.\r\n\r\nWhen stewing meat, you're playing a racing game between two simultaneous processes. First is the conversion of connective tissues to gelatin. This softens the meat and makes it taste moister. On the other hand, muscle proteins are constantly contracting and squeezing out internal moisture. This hardens the meat and makes it tougher.\r\n\r\nIdeally, by the time the connective tissue has softened (and this happens quite quickly and suddenly—your beef stays tough right up to the moment that it isn't), the muscles will still have allowed some natural juices to remain and you end up with soft, tender, juicy meat. Let it cook too long (or simmer too hard) and the muscles will have pressed out so much moisture that even the added lubrication of the broken down connective tissue can't help it.\r\n\r\nThe exact timing is dependent on exactly how your oven works and on the exact cut of meat you have, but with large chunks of beef in a 275°F (135°C) oven with the lid cracked, it takes around 2 1/2 hours to properly tenderize. I start poking my meat after about 2 1/4 hours and check in every so often until the meat is just on the brink of being tender enough to cut with a spoon (it'll continue cooking a little even after it comes out of the oven). By this stage, my added vegetables are also perfectly cooked and the broth has reduced into a shiny, rich sauce.\r\n\r\nAs I discovered through an informal Twitter survey, folks are divided on the subject of peas in stew. I'm in favor of them, but only if they are frozen peas added right at the end so they retain their bright green pop. You can do with them what you will.\r\n\r\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\r\nBeef Stew Rule #13: Eat it Today, Eat it Tomorrow, it Doesn't Matter\r\n\r\nAnd there we go! Our stew is done stewed. Fish out the thyme sprigs and bay leaves (or leave them in like my mom did), season the broth to taste (it probably won't need much more salt but will need more pepper), and serve it up.\r\n\r\nWait a minute. We've all heard that stews get better over the course of a few days, right? We put this to the test, and found there isn't much difference.

This ensures the chili has some browned beef flavor, while maintaining large chunks of tender beef.</li></ul><div>&nbsp;The last time I <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-the-best-chili-ever-recipe-super-bowl\">tackled chili</a> it was a contentious post! It's always a gamble to call something \"the best ever,\" but to use that expression to describe chili—perhaps the single most contentious, zealotry-inducing, divisive food in the country—is just <em>asking</em> for trouble.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;For the record, my recipe ended up including tomatoes, star anise, chocolate, coffee, anchovies, soy sauce, marmite, and yes, even <em>beans</em> (the horror!).&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Well, Texans, today I aim to make it up to you. The recipe we're discussing now is real-deal chili con carne, old school Texas-style. What does that mean? First of all, absolutely no beans. No tomatoes. Indeed, there's very little that goes into the pot other than beef and chiles (and plenty of both!). That doesn't mean there aren't a few things to discuss, however. Let's get to it.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;The Meat<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;The original chili was made with dried beef pounded together with suet and dried chilies into a sort of pemmican-like dry mix intended to last a long time and be quick and nutritious for cowboys to rehydrate and stew up out on the range. These days, we've got refrigerators and fresh meat. So we use them.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;What we're looking for here is a meat that's good for stewing—that is, rich in connective tissue and fat and high in flavor. In general, beef falls across a spectrum of tenderness with relatively bland cuts on one end and very flavorful but tough cuts on the other. These cuts generally correspond with muscles that the steers use least to most during their life.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;So on the far left side would be relatively unworked muscles like tenderloin or loin cuts (strip steak, porterhouse, etc.). Very tender, but relatively flavorless. On the other end of the spectrum are hard working muscles like, say short ribs, shin, oxtail, or chuck (shoulder).&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Chuck is essentially the ideal stew cut</strong> with great flavor, a good amount of fat, and plenty of connective tissue all in one well-balanced package.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;As the meat slowly cooks down in flavorful liquid, all of that connective tissue—mostly composed of the protein collagen—breaks down into rich gelatin, which is what gives good stewed beef its luxurious texture.<br><br></div><div>&nbsp;Cut and Sear&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>The chili of my youth was made of ground beef</strong>, which is key if you don't want to spend the time to properly stew your meat. Grinding beef shortens its fibers, making it far more tender. A ground beef chili can be ready to eat in under an hour. But that's not what we're after. Real Texas chili is made with big chunks of meat and requires plenty of slow stewing.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;I played around with a few different sizes and settled on large two-inch chunks (they shrink to about an inch and a half after cooking). I like having to shred a large cube of beef apart with my spoon before eating it, if only to constantly remind myself how perfectly tender the meat has become.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;As for searing, there's always a trade-off. Searing helps develop nice browned flavors via the Maillard reaction, but it also results in tougher, dryer meat. See, at the high temperatures required for browning, meat muscle fibers contract to greatly and expel so much liquid that even after a long simmer in the pot, the edges of the meat cubes are relatively dry. I vastly prefer the softer texture of unseared meat.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;The solution? <em>Just sear half of the cubes and on one side only</em>. You develop plenty of browned flavor, but retain good texture in the rest of the meat. Worried that the flavor will only be concentrated on the meat that you sear? Don't sweat it. Most of those flavorful compounds are water soluble, meaning that there's plenty of time for them to dissolve and distribute themselves all around the stew as it cooks.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Where's the Heat?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Next up, the chilies. Arguably the most important ingredient in the pot. After all, we're making chili con carne (chili with meat), <strong>not</strong> carne con chili.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Tip number one: <strong>Stay away from powdered chiles</strong>. I mean it, I really do. Chile powders are gritty, not very well balanced in flavor, and can quickly lose their flavors as they sit on the supermarket shelf. Much better is to use whole dried chiles. They come in a dizzying variety, but most fall into one of four categories in terms of flavor. Let me recap from my previous chile article:&nbsp;</div><ul><li><strong>Sweet and fresh:</strong> These peppers have distinct aromas reminiscent of red bell peppers and fresh tomatoes. They include: costeño, New Mexico (aka dried Anaheim, California, or Colorado), and choricero.</li><li><strong>Hot:</strong> An overwhelming heat. The best, like cascabels also have some complexity, while others like the pequin or arbol, are all heat, and not much else.</li><li><strong>Smoky:</strong> Some chile peppers, like chipotles (dried, smoked jalapeños), are smoky because of the way they are dried. Others, like ñora or guajillo have a natural musty, charred wood, smokiness.</li><li><strong>Rich and Fruity:</strong> Distinct aromas of sun-dried tomatoes, raisins, chocolate, and coffee. Some of the best-known Mexican chiles, like ancho, mulato, and pasilla, are in this category.</li></ul><div>&nbsp;The key to great deep chili flavor is to use a good mix of chiles, trying to grab at least one from each category. To be honest, I don't follow a strict protocol when mixing chiles—my choice varies from batch to batch—but this time I went with a combination of fiery arbols and cascabels, sweet costeños, some chilpotles canned in adobo sauce, a couple of ñoras, and some fruity negros and pasillas. A little overboard? Perhaps. But nothings too good for my chili.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Remember: <em>dried chiles do have a shelf life</em>. Just like dried herbs and spices, they can lose their potency over time. I store my chiles in vacuum-sealed bags in the refrigerator (though regular zipper-lock bags will do just fine).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;You <em>can</em> grind all of your peppers together into a custom-blended chili powder, but even the best grinder will leave you with chile pieces that can turn your liquid gritty. I prefer to simmer my dried chilies in chicken stock* before blending them all together with a hand mixer.&nbsp;</div><div><em>*If you have homemade beef stock, you can use that. Don't use canned beef stock—it never tastes as natural or meaty as canned chicken stock.</em></div><div>&nbsp;Stewed Up&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;And... that's about it. Beef, chiles, and time are all it takes. I occasionally add an onion and perhaps a few cloves of garlic that I sauté in the pan after braising the beef. If I'm feeling especially feisty, I may also add a few spices from the rack. Cumin, cinnamon, allspice, a bit of dried oregano, all are good in small quantities, but totally optional.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;The only question left is how to stew the meat. Ideally you want to cook the meat at as low a temperature as possible (to avoid causing undue muscle fiber contraction), while still softening its connective tissues. The easiest way to to this at home is to use a very large, heavy pot with plenty of surface area for evaporation (this helps limit the stew's maximum temperature), and to either use as low a flame as possible on the stovetop, or better yet, put the pot directly into a low-temperature (200°F is good) oven, which will heat more gently and evenly than a burner.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Leaving the lid slightly cracked reduces vapor pressure on the surface of the stew, which can also limit its upper temperature limit. With a heavy lid, stew temperatures can push up to 212°F. Leave that same lid slightly cracked, and your stew will stay closer to 190° or 180°F—much better. Even slow cooked meat can be overcooked so you want to carefully monitor your stew and pull it off the heat <em>just</em> when the meat becomes tender. This usually takes about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;You can leave the chili as is, but I like to thicken mine with a bit of corn masa.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Like all good marriages, the marriage between beef and chili gets better and more intimate with time. Let the chili sit overnight in the fridge and it'll taste even better the next day. I promise, it's worth the wait. Meaty? Check. Hot, rich, complex chile flavor? Check.

This ensures the chili has some browned beef flavor, while maintaining large chunks of tender beef.</li></ul><div> The last time I <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-the-best-chili-ever-recipe-super-bowl\">tackled chili</a> it was a contentious post! It's always a gamble to call something \"the best ever,\" but to use that expression to describe chili—perhaps the single most contentious, zealotry-inducing, divisive food in the country—is just <em>asking</em> for trouble. </div><div> For the record, my recipe ended up including tomatoes, star anise, chocolate, coffee, anchovies, soy sauce, marmite, and yes, even <em>beans</em> (the horror!). </div><div> Well, Texans, today I aim to make it up to you. The recipe we're discussing now is real-deal chili con carne, old school Texas-style. What does that mean? First of all, absolutely no beans. No tomatoes. Indeed, there's very little that goes into the pot other than beef and chiles (and plenty of both!). That doesn't mean there aren't a few things to discuss, however. Let's get to it. </div><div> The Meat<br><br></div><div><br></div><div> The original chili was made with dried beef pounded together with suet and dried chilies into a sort of pemmican-like dry mix intended to last a long time and be quick and nutritious for cowboys to rehydrate and stew up out on the range. These days, we've got refrigerators and fresh meat. So we use them. </div><div> What we're looking for here is a meat that's good for stewing—that is, rich in connective tissue and fat and high in flavor. In general, beef falls across a spectrum of tenderness with relatively bland cuts on one end and very flavorful but tough cuts on the other. These cuts generally correspond with muscles that the steers use least to most during their life. </div><div> So on the far left side would be relatively unworked muscles like tenderloin or loin cuts (strip steak, porterhouse, etc.). Very tender, but relatively flavorless. On the other end of the spectrum are hard working muscles like, say short ribs, shin, oxtail, or chuck (shoulder). </div><div><strong>Chuck is essentially the ideal stew cut</strong> with great flavor, a good amount of fat, and plenty of connective tissue all in one well-balanced package. </div><div><br></div><div> As the meat slowly cooks down in flavorful liquid, all of that connective tissue—mostly composed of the protein collagen—breaks down into rich gelatin, which is what gives good stewed beef its luxurious texture.<br><br></div><div> Cut and Sear </div><div><br></div><div><strong>The chili of my youth was made of ground beef</strong>, which is key if you don't want to spend the time to properly stew your meat. Grinding beef shortens its fibers, making it far more tender. A ground beef chili can be ready to eat in under an hour. But that's not what we're after. Real Texas chili is made with big chunks of meat and requires plenty of slow stewing. </div><div> I played around with a few different sizes and settled on large two-inch chunks (they shrink to about an inch and a half after cooking). I like having to shred a large cube of beef apart with my spoon before eating it, if only to constantly remind myself how perfectly tender the meat has become. </div><div><br></div><div> As for searing, there's always a trade-off. Searing helps develop nice browned flavors via the Maillard reaction, but it also results in tougher, dryer meat. See, at the high temperatures required for browning, meat muscle fibers contract to greatly and expel so much liquid that even after a long simmer in the pot, the edges of the meat cubes are relatively dry. I vastly prefer the softer texture of unseared meat. </div><div> The solution? <em>Just sear half of the cubes and on one side only</em>. You develop plenty of browned flavor, but retain good texture in the rest of the meat. Worried that the flavor will only be concentrated on the meat that you sear? Don't sweat it. Most of those flavorful compounds are water soluble, meaning that there's plenty of time for them to dissolve and distribute themselves all around the stew as it cooks. </div><div> Where's the Heat? </div><div><br></div><div> Next up, the chilies. Arguably the most important ingredient in the pot. After all, we're making chili con carne (chili with meat), <strong>not</strong> carne con chili. </div><div> Tip number one: <strong>Stay away from powdered chiles</strong>. I mean it, I really do. Chile powders are gritty, not very well balanced in flavor, and can quickly lose their flavors as they sit on the supermarket shelf. Much better is to use whole dried chiles. They come in a dizzying variety, but most fall into one of four categories in terms of flavor. Let me recap from my previous chile article: </div><ul><li><strong>Sweet and fresh:</strong> These peppers have distinct aromas reminiscent of red bell peppers and fresh tomatoes. They include: costeño, New Mexico (aka dried Anaheim, California, or Colorado), and choricero.</li><li><strong>Hot:</strong> An overwhelming heat. The best, like cascabels also have some complexity, while others like the pequin or arbol, are all heat, and not much else.</li><li><strong>Smoky:</strong> Some chile peppers, like chipotles (dried, smoked jalapeños), are smoky because of the way they are dried. Others, like ñora or guajillo have a natural musty, charred wood, smokiness.</li><li><strong>Rich and Fruity:</strong> Distinct aromas of sun-dried tomatoes, raisins, chocolate, and coffee. Some of the best-known Mexican chiles, like ancho, mulato, and pasilla, are in this category.</li></ul><div> The key to great deep chili flavor is to use a good mix of chiles, trying to grab at least one from each category. To be honest, I don't follow a strict protocol when mixing chiles—my choice varies from batch to batch—but this time I went with a combination of fiery arbols and cascabels, sweet costeños, some chilpotles canned in adobo sauce, a couple of ñoras, and some fruity negros and pasillas. A little overboard? Perhaps. But nothings too good for my chili. </div><div> Remember: <em>dried chiles do have a shelf life</em>. Just like dried herbs and spices, they can lose their potency over time. I store my chiles in vacuum-sealed bags in the refrigerator (though regular zipper-lock bags will do just fine). </div><div><br></div><div> You <em>can</em> grind all of your peppers together into a custom-blended chili powder, but even the best grinder will leave you with chile pieces that can turn your liquid gritty. I prefer to simmer my dried chilies in chicken stock* before blending them all together with a hand mixer. </div><div><em>*If you have homemade beef stock, you can use that. Don't use canned beef stock—it never tastes as natural or meaty as canned chicken stock.</em></div><div> Stewed Up </div><div><br></div><div> And... that's about it. Beef, chiles, and time are all it takes. I occasionally add an onion and perhaps a few cloves of garlic that I sauté in the pan after braising the beef. If I'm feeling especially feisty, I may also add a few spices from the rack. Cumin, cinnamon, allspice, a bit of dried oregano, all are good in small quantities, but totally optional. </div><div> The only question left is how to stew the meat. Ideally you want to cook the meat at as low a temperature as possible (to avoid causing undue muscle fiber contraction), while still softening its connective tissues. The easiest way to to this at home is to use a very large, heavy pot with plenty of surface area for evaporation (this helps limit the stew's maximum temperature), and to either use as low a flame as possible on the stovetop, or better yet, put the pot directly into a low-temperature (200°F is good) oven, which will heat more gently and evenly than a burner. </div><div> Leaving the lid slightly cracked reduces vapor pressure on the surface of the stew, which can also limit its upper temperature limit. With a heavy lid, stew temperatures can push up to 212°F. Leave that same lid slightly cracked, and your stew will stay closer to 190° or 180°F—much better. Even slow cooked meat can be overcooked so you want to carefully monitor your stew and pull it off the heat <em>just</em> when the meat becomes tender. This usually takes about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div> You can leave the chili as is, but I like to thicken mine with a bit of corn masa. </div><div> Like all good marriages, the marriage between beef and chili gets better and more intimate with time. Let the chili sit overnight in the fridge and it'll taste even better the next day. I promise, it's worth the wait. Meaty? Check. Hot, rich, complex chile flavor? Check. And that's really all Texas chili needs. </div><div> A sprinkle of cilantro, sliced scallions, and perhaps some cheese (I used Cotija—jack, Colby, or cheddar will all work fine) make for good accompaniments. As do warm tortillas. As does some good beer or whiskey. And fine, if you'd like, you can go ahead and add a can of beans.

Food has history. Food is culture. It should be taken seriously and respectfully. But at the same time, it's meant to be delicious and give pleasure. What started in the French region of Languedoc as a humble peasant dish of dried beans cooked with various sausages and preserved meats—think of it as southern France's Beanee-Weenees—has turned into an all-out culture war with not one, not two, but <em>three</em> towns all claiming to be the originators of the One True Cassoulet.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;You thought local sports fans are insane? You should head over to one of those medieval walled cities—Toulouse, Castelnaudary, and Carcassonne all have claims to the dish—and chat with some local cassoulet chefs to see what a <em>true</em> fanatic is like. The comparison is not as crazy as it sounds—members of the <a href=\"http://www.academie-du-cassoulet.com/uk/index.php\">Académie Universelle du Cassoulet</a> wear brightly colored uniforms, hand out medals, and wave banners just like sports fans. (I didn't spot any cassoulet cheerleaders twirling confit goose legs along the walls of Carcassonne when I visited, but I wouldn't be surprised if they exist.)&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Here's the truth of the matter: Cassoulet is a medieval peasant dish designed to make do with whatever was around. In Languedoc, that happened to be dried beans, preserved duck, and preserved pork. Do you think any medieval French peasant would turn their nose up at the pot of beans because someone had dared to make it partridge-free?&nbsp;</div><div>Real-deal cassoulet in Languedoc.&nbsp;<br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div>&nbsp;The first time I had cassoulet in its home turf (the Carcassonne version, in fact), it was a revelation: The cassoulet I'd known for nearly all of my professional career is <em>nothing</em> like the cassoulet found in Languedoc. It's as if I'd spent my life in the kitchen at Giordano's in Chicago and just found out that there's a style of pizza beyond deep dish and that not only that, but <em>I'm the weird one here</em>. That loose, almost soup-like stew of beans and meat was so far removed from all versions of cassoulet I'd had in the United States, or even in other parts of France. Gone was the stodgy, stew-like broth. Gone were the bread crumb toppings. Gone were the extra vegetables.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Instead, we were presented with a large, bubbling vat of beans and meat, covered in a crust so dark that it was almost <em>black</em>. Our hostess cracked open the crust to reveal beans swimming in a rich, gelatinous broth with bits of tender duck leg, cured pork belly, pork shanks, and a few different sausages.&nbsp;</div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div>&nbsp;Just as in a good risotto, the cassoulet flowed slowly across the plate, spreading out into a loose sauce. None of that solid-enough-to-mound stuff I'd seen everywhere else. Flavor-wise, it was different too. Rich, meaty, and overwhelmingly simple, there were a few background notes from aromatic vegetables—onions, carrots, celery, a few cloves, perhaps some bay leaf and parsley—but the main flavor was just that of the cured meat, a good stock, and beans.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;The beans were cooked to the point of maximum creaminess—like a good loose hamburger, they were held together with nothing more than hope, melting on your tongue as soon as they hit your mouth. Similarly, all of the meats were meltingly tender, to the point where the only real texture was from the crust.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Like I said: simple, peasant fare.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;The thing is, I <em>thought</em> I knew what cassoulet was before trying it in Languedoc. I made it at fancy pants restaurants. I'd eaten it everywhere from New York to Paris. I'd bought it in ridiculously expensive imported jars. I spent months developing a recipe for <em>Cook's Illustrated</em> that never saw the light of day.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;But <em>none</em> of them ever came close to the real thing. Too thick, too fussy, too breadcrumb-y.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;The version I'm giving you today <em>does</em>. And like any good peasant fare, it requires very little technique or skill, but does require a bit of time and TLC.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;So how does one take this simple country dish and bring it home? Come along and I'll show you.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Why I Use Chicken In Cassoulet&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;I need to get one thing off my chest right off the bat here: I am <em>not</em> using duck or goose confit in my cassoulet. I am using plain old chicken legs.&nbsp;</div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div>&nbsp;I started tackling this recipe with the thought that I'd use duck—I even developed a recipe for making confit yourself from scratch. Then it struck me: I'm spending <em>days</em> making what is meant to be a simple peasant dish, and not only that, but by doing so, the end result is actually <em>less</em> true to the original. How so?&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Well, duck is an ingredient in traditional cassoulet not by choice, but by <em>necessity</em>. Back in the days before refrigeration, duck meat was preserved by heavily salting it, slow-cooking it, then packing it under a layer of its own fat. Sure, it turns out that this produces a fantastically tasty end product, but you can make cassoulet without it. I'd argue that the most important part of the confit process—the slow cooking to tenderize tough connective tissue—could be considered wasted in a dish like cassoulet where the meat ends up getting slow-cooked anyway.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;So why chicken? Well, duck happened to be very common and inexpensive in medieval Southern France. In modern urban America, not so much. You <em>could</em> go out and buy duck legs to use for this recipe, but chicken is cheap, widely available, and easy to work with.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Here's another thing: Most of the distinguishing flavor in a particular type of meat comes from the fat. So instead of just using duck, what if I were to incorporate a bit of store-bought duck fat?&nbsp;</div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div>&nbsp;I used that duck fat to brown the meat and bingo: true ducky, cassoulet flavor without any need for actual duck. I'd offer a cash reward for anyone who submits themselves to a Pepsi challenge and blind-tastes a bit of slow-cooked chicken and slow-cooked duck from the same pot of cassoulet prepared with duck fat and can tell me which is which.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Even without the duck fat, a chicken-based cassoulet is killer, so don't sweat it if you can't find or don't want to shell out for it.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;A Porky Duo for Flavor-Packed Cassoulet&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;After the poultry, the pork is the next most important flavoring element in the cassoulet. Sausages are a must. In Languedoc, you'd typically find a garlicky pork sausage flavored with a bit of red wine. Back here, I like to use whatever mild garlic sausage I can find.&nbsp;</div><div>Ham hocks and pork belly in the pot.&nbsp;<br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div>&nbsp;For the cured, fatty element, I tried various cuts, including salted pork belly, regular bacon, pancetta, salted fatback, and salted smoked ham hocks. Both the bacon and hocks imparted too much smoky flavor to the mix. Fatback was just too fatty, and pancetta was immediately identifiable. Salted pork belly (usually sold as \"salt pork\" in the meat or sausage case) was the way to go.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;I decided to start my cassoulet by rendering the fat from the pork belly with duck fat and using that combination to brown the rest of my ingredients.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Browning it as a whole piece before slicing it into smaller chunks for slow cooking seemed like a good way to go about it, but in the interest of saving time and streamlining, I settled on cutting it into chunks before browning. This gave more surface area for rendering fat to escape, as well as more surface for browning, which led to deeper flavor in the finished dish.&nbsp;</div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div>&nbsp;I tried cutting the meat into various sizes from thin strips to little 1/4-inch lardons, and I found that I much preferred larger, meatier cubes measuring about 3/4 inch. Rendering them relatively slowly helps to get them to release maximum fat without burning or singeing around the edges. Once the meat is golden brown and has rendered most of its fat, I take it back out of the pot.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;How to Brown Chicken&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;One thing that's not necessary, and which I learned the hard way: salting your chicken. There's already a ton of salt that makes it into the dish from the salt pork and other ingredients, not to mention the liquid that slowly reduces in the oven. Just a few solid grinds of pepper are all it takes before the chicken is ready to go for a swim in the hot rendered pork fat.&nbsp;</div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div>&nbsp;When adding the chicken to the hot fat, lower it in gently, letting your hand get down right to the surface.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;After that, let it do its thing: don't poke and prod that chicken too much, and <em>definitely</em> don't flip it until it is deeply, deeply browned. All that flavor is going to go right into your beans. Take out the chicken after browning both sides and set it aside with the pork belly. Then, brown the sausage on both sides, take it out, and set it aside.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Two Ways with Cassoulet Aromatics&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Now comes a deeper question: how to incorporate the aromatics. Some recipes I've seen call for onions, carrots, celery, and garlic all to be finely chopped and left in the finished dish. I personally find the little bits of vegetables very distracting.&nbsp;</div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div>&nbsp;Instead, I chop only the onion and add it to the pot after the meat is done browning, using the steam and moisture it gives off to deglaze the pan, scraping up all the flavorful browned bits that the meat left behind. As for the other aromatics—a carrot, a couple stalks of celery, a head of garlic, some sprigs of parsley, a couple bay leaves, and few cloves—I find leaving them in large chunks and using them to flavor the stock in which I cook the beans is the best way to extract subtle flavor without the distracting bits of vegetable in the finished dish.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;As for the beans, I tested my recipes using a few different types of dried white beans, from actual lingot beans I brought back from Languedoc to cannellini and small navy beans. Cannellini were the best domestic option. I tried cooking them a number of ways, from canned (no good—they don't develop flavor the way I'd like and their liquid doesn't thicken up enough as they cook) to non-soaked to soaked-and-cooked to completely pre-cooked before adding to the rest of the ingredients.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;The best method was somewhere in between. I start by <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/beans-legumes-pulses-varieties-recipes-cooking-tips#:~:text=%22For%20the%20best%2C%20creamiest%2C,the%20cooking%20water%20as%20well.%22\">soaking my beans in a salty brine</a>. Despite what you may have heard about salt preventing beans from softening properly, it actually accomplishes the exact opposite goal: salt ensures that bean skins turn tender.&nbsp;</div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div>&nbsp;After draining the soaked beans I add them to the pot with the onions, a quart of store-bought chicken stock, and the aromatics. I simmer them until just shy of cooked before fishing out the spent aromatics, adding the meats back in, mixing everything around, and throwing it all into a low oven to finish cooking.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Getting a Crisp Skin Without a Traditional Cassoulet Pot&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Baking is where the real magic of cassoulet happens. See, a good stock should be rich with proteins, and just like the proteins in meat, they brown when heated. As you cook a cassoulet in the oven, the top layer of liquid slowly evaporates, leaving an ever more concentrated layer of proteins on its surface. Eventually, these proteins form a raft-like skin.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;By occasionally removing the cassoulet from the oven and breaking that skin, allowing fresh liquid to flow above it (traditionalists will tell you that seven times is the optimal number of breaks for the best skin), you build up a significant layer of skin. It's this skin that browns, forming the crust of a traditional cassoulet.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Baking in this way transforms this:&nbsp;</div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div>&nbsp;Into this:&nbsp;</div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div>&nbsp;At least, that's what's <em>supposed</em> to happen.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;The sad reality is that most of the cassoulets I've cooked in the past have ended up looking like this:&nbsp;</div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div>&nbsp;What's the problem?&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;First off, it's the shape of the pan. A traditional cassoulet pot, called a <a href=\"https://newclaypottery.com/product/cassole-cassoulet/\">cassole</a>, is tapered from top to bottom, giving it an extremely high surface area to volume ratio. More room for evaporation means better skin formation and better browning. In fact, the last two pictures above are of cassoulets cooked in the exact same manner, the only difference being the vessel they are cooked in.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Unfortunately, it's tough to find a good cassole around here.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;A regular cassoulet will form a crust in about four hours of cooking in a 300°F (150°C) oven. What about if you just cook your Dutch oven cassoulet for longer or hotter? I tried a variety of time and temperature ranges. At the very best, what you end up with is this:&nbsp;</div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div>&nbsp;Decent crust alright, but the crust is really formed by the beans and the meat, not by the liquid itself. Underneath, the beans are too dry.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;The second problem is the store-bought stock I'd been using. <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/best-rich-easy-white-chicken-stock-recipe\">Homemade chicken stock</a> tends to be very high in gelatin, a result of the high amount of connective tissue in the bones and cartilage used to make it. Store-bought stock, by contrast, is thin and watery. It's the gelatin proteins that forms the crusty raft on top of the cassoulet, giving it both crust and body.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;It's these two problems—wrong pot, not enough gelatin in the stock—that lead many recipes to resort to using breadcrumbs to create an artificial crust.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;So what's the solution? Well, the obvious one is to just make your own stock. It's actually way easier than it sounds, though it again requires a bit of a time commitment. I'll admit it: sometimes even I'm too lazy to make my own stock when I've already got a day-long project ahead of me.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;So what's the next best thing?&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Just fake it.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;By blooming <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-use-gelatin-better-stock-sauce-dessert\">store-bought unflavored gelatin</a> in regular store-bought stock, you can create a rich stock full of body that forms a raft just like the real deal. I don't go easy on the gelatin either (remember, you have to make up for using the wrong-shaped pot as well). A full three packets for a quart of liquid gives it the body and crust I'm looking for.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;In order to get a cassoulet that stays nice and loose underneath while still building a crust up top, it's important not to drown that crust out. If your liquid level starts to get too low, add more liquid (plain water works) to the pot by carefully pouring it along the side of the pot so that it goes <em>under</em> the crust, not over it.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Break into the cassoulet's crust, and underneath, you've got creamy, flavor-packed beans with meltingly tender nubs of pork belly, sausage, and chicken legs that fall off the bone in moist shreds, all in a rich, sticky liquid that drinks like liquid pork.&nbsp;</div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div>&nbsp;This is the kind of fare that demands you sit down and make an event out of it, good Languedoc wine and all.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;It's the kind of meal so rich and hearty that all you could possibly eat on the side is a <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/simple-vinaigrette\">simple green salad (preferably with an excellent French vinaigrette)</a>.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;I mean, just look at it!&nbsp;</div><div><br>Serious Eats / J.

Add meats to pot and stir to incorporate, making sure that the chicken pieces end up on top of the beans with the skin facing upwards. Beans should be almost completely submerged. Transfer to oven and cook, uncovered, until a thin crust forms on top, about 2 hours, adding more water by pouring it carefully down the side of the pot, as necessary, to keep beans mostly covered.&nbsp;</li><li><br></li><li>&nbsp;Break crust with a spoon and shake pot gently to redistribute. Return to oven and continue cooking, stopping to break and shake the crust every 30 minutes until you reach the 4 1/2 hour mark.

Rich, meaty, and overwhelmingly simple, there were a few background notes from aromatic vegetables—onions, carrots, celery, a few cloves, perhaps some bay leaf and parsley—but the main flavor was just that of the cured meat, a good stock, and beans. </div><div> The beans were cooked to the point of maximum creaminess—like a good loose hamburger, they were held together with nothing more than hope, melting on your tongue as soon as they hit your mouth. Similarly, all of the meats were meltingly tender, to the point where the only real texture was from the crust. </div><div> Like I said: simple, peasant fare. </div><div> The thing is, I <em>thought</em> I knew what cassoulet was before trying it in Languedoc. I made it at fancy pants restaurants. I'd eaten it everywhere from New York to Paris. I'd bought it in ridiculously expensive imported jars. I spent months developing a recipe for <em>Cook's Illustrated</em> that never saw the light of day. </div><div> But <em>none</em> of them ever came close to the real thing. Too thick, too fussy, too breadcrumb-y. </div><div> The version I'm giving you today <em>does</em>. And like any good peasant fare, it requires very little technique or skill, but does require a bit of time and TLC. </div><div> So how does one take this simple country dish and bring it home? Come along and I'll show you. </div><div> Why I Use Chicken In Cassoulet </div><div> I need to get one thing off my chest right off the bat here: I am <em>not</em> using duck or goose confit in my cassoulet. I am using plain old chicken legs. </div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div> I started tackling this recipe with the thought that I'd use duck—I even developed a recipe for making confit yourself from scratch. Then it struck me: I'm spending <em>days</em> making what is meant to be a simple peasant dish, and not only that, but by doing so, the end result is actually <em>less</em> true to the original. How so? </div><div> Well, duck is an ingredient in traditional cassoulet not by choice, but by <em>necessity</em>. Back in the days before refrigeration, duck meat was preserved by heavily salting it, slow-cooking it, then packing it under a layer of its own fat. Sure, it turns out that this produces a fantastically tasty end product, but you can make cassoulet without it. I'd argue that the most important part of the confit process—the slow cooking to tenderize tough connective tissue—could be considered wasted in a dish like cassoulet where the meat ends up getting slow-cooked anyway. </div><div> So why chicken? Well, duck happened to be very common and inexpensive in medieval Southern France. In modern urban America, not so much. You <em>could</em> go out and buy duck legs to use for this recipe, but chicken is cheap, widely available, and easy to work with. </div><div> Here's another thing: Most of the distinguishing flavor in a particular type of meat comes from the fat. So instead of just using duck, what if I were to incorporate a bit of store-bought duck fat? </div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div> I used that duck fat to brown the meat and bingo: true ducky, cassoulet flavor without any need for actual duck. I'd offer a cash reward for anyone who submits themselves to a Pepsi challenge and blind-tastes a bit of slow-cooked chicken and slow-cooked duck from the same pot of cassoulet prepared with duck fat and can tell me which is which. </div><div> Even without the duck fat, a chicken-based cassoulet is killer, so don't sweat it if you can't find or don't want to shell out for it. </div><div> A Porky Duo for Flavor-Packed Cassoulet </div><div> After the poultry, the pork is the next most important flavoring element in the cassoulet. Sausages are a must. In Languedoc, you'd typically find a garlicky pork sausage flavored with a bit of red wine. Back here, I like to use whatever mild garlic sausage I can find. </div><div>Ham hocks and pork belly in the pot. <br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div> For the cured, fatty element, I tried various cuts, including salted pork belly, regular bacon, pancetta, salted fatback, and salted smoked ham hocks. Both the bacon and hocks imparted too much smoky flavor to the mix. Fatback was just too fatty, and pancetta was immediately identifiable. Salted pork belly (usually sold as \"salt pork\" in the meat or sausage case) was the way to go. </div><div> I decided to start my cassoulet by rendering the fat from the pork belly with duck fat and using that combination to brown the rest of my ingredients. </div><div> Browning it as a whole piece before slicing it into smaller chunks for slow cooking seemed like a good way to go about it, but in the interest of saving time and streamlining, I settled on cutting it into chunks before browning. This gave more surface area for rendering fat to escape, as well as more surface for browning, which led to deeper flavor in the finished dish. </div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div> I tried cutting the meat into various sizes from thin strips to little 1/4-inch lardons, and I found that I much preferred larger, meatier cubes measuring about 3/4 inch. Rendering them relatively slowly helps to get them to release maximum fat without burning or singeing around the edges. Once the meat is golden brown and has rendered most of its fat, I take it back out of the pot. </div><div> How to Brown Chicken </div><div> One thing that's not necessary, and which I learned the hard way: salting your chicken. There's already a ton of salt that makes it into the dish from the salt pork and other ingredients, not to mention the liquid that slowly reduces in the oven. Just a few solid grinds of pepper are all it takes before the chicken is ready to go for a swim in the hot rendered pork fat. </div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div> When adding the chicken to the hot fat, lower it in gently, letting your hand get down right to the surface. </div><div> After that, let it do its thing: don't poke and prod that chicken too much, and <em>definitely</em> don't flip it until it is deeply, deeply browned. All that flavor is going to go right into your beans. Take out the chicken after browning both sides and set it aside with the pork belly. Then, brown the sausage on both sides, take it out, and set it aside. </div><div> Two Ways with Cassoulet Aromatics </div><div> Now comes a deeper question: how to incorporate the aromatics. Some recipes I've seen call for onions, carrots, celery, and garlic all to be finely chopped and left in the finished dish. I personally find the little bits of vegetables very distracting. </div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div> Instead, I chop only the onion and add it to the pot after the meat is done browning, using the steam and moisture it gives off to deglaze the pan, scraping up all the flavorful browned bits that the meat left behind. As for the other aromatics—a carrot, a couple stalks of celery, a head of garlic, some sprigs of parsley, a couple bay leaves, and few cloves—I find leaving them in large chunks and using them to flavor the stock in which I cook the beans is the best way to extract subtle flavor without the distracting bits of vegetable in the finished dish. </div><div> As for the beans, I tested my recipes using a few different types of dried white beans, from actual lingot beans I brought back from Languedoc to cannellini and small navy beans. Cannellini were the best domestic option. I tried cooking them a number of ways, from canned (no good—they don't develop flavor the way I'd like and their liquid doesn't thicken up enough as they cook) to non-soaked to soaked-and-cooked to completely pre-cooked before adding to the rest of the ingredients. </div><div> The best method was somewhere in between. I start by <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/beans-legumes-pulses-varieties-recipes-cooking-tips#:~:text=%22For%20the%20best%2C%20creamiest%2C,the%20cooking%20water%20as%20well.%22\">soaking my beans in a salty brine</a>. Despite what you may have heard about salt preventing beans from softening properly, it actually accomplishes the exact opposite goal: salt ensures that bean skins turn tender. </div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div> After draining the soaked beans I add them to the pot with the onions, a quart of store-bought chicken stock, and the aromatics. I simmer them until just shy of cooked before fishing out the spent aromatics, adding the meats back in, mixing everything around, and throwing it all into a low oven to finish cooking. </div><div> Getting a Crisp Skin Without a Traditional Cassoulet Pot </div><div> Baking is where the real magic of cassoulet happens. See, a good stock should be rich with proteins, and just like the proteins in meat, they brown when heated. As you cook a cassoulet in the oven, the top layer of liquid slowly evaporates, leaving an ever more concentrated layer of proteins on its surface. Eventually, these proteins form a raft-like skin. </div><div> By occasionally removing the cassoulet from the oven and breaking that skin, allowing fresh liquid to flow above it (traditionalists will tell you that seven times is the optimal number of breaks for the best skin), you build up a significant layer of skin. It's this skin that browns, forming the crust of a traditional cassoulet. </div><div> Baking in this way transforms this: </div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div> Into this: </div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div> At least, that's what's <em>supposed</em> to happen. </div><div> The sad reality is that most of the cassoulets I've cooked in the past have ended up looking like this: </div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div> What's the problem? </div><div> First off, it's the shape of the pan. A traditional cassoulet pot, called a <a href=\"https://newclaypottery.com/product/cassole-cassoulet/\">cassole</a>, is tapered from top to bottom, giving it an extremely high surface area to volume ratio. More room for evaporation means better skin formation and better browning. In fact, the last two pictures above are of cassoulets cooked in the exact same manner, the only difference being the vessel they are cooked in. </div><div> Unfortunately, it's tough to find a good cassole around here. </div><div> A regular cassoulet will form a crust in about four hours of cooking in a 300°F (150°C) oven. What about if you just cook your Dutch oven cassoulet for longer or hotter? I tried a variety of time and temperature ranges. At the very best, what you end up with is this: </div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div> Decent crust alright, but the crust is really formed by the beans and the meat, not by the liquid itself. Underneath, the beans are too dry. </div><div> The second problem is the store-bought stock I'd been using. <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/best-rich-easy-white-chicken-stock-recipe\">Homemade chicken stock</a> tends to be very high in gelatin, a result of the high amount of connective tissue in the bones and cartilage used to make it. Store-bought stock, by contrast, is thin and watery. It's the gelatin proteins that forms the crusty raft on top of the cassoulet, giving it both crust and body. </div><div> It's these two problems—wrong pot, not enough gelatin in the stock—that lead many recipes to resort to using breadcrumbs to create an artificial crust. </div><div> So what's the solution? Well, the obvious one is to just make your own stock. It's actually way easier than it sounds, though it again requires a bit of a time commitment. I'll admit it: sometimes even I'm too lazy to make my own stock when I've already got a day-long project ahead of me. </div><div> So what's the next best thing? </div><div> Just fake it. </div><div> By blooming <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-use-gelatin-better-stock-sauce-dessert\">store-bought unflavored gelatin</a> in regular store-bought stock, you can create a rich stock full of body that forms a raft just like the real deal. I don't go easy on the gelatin either (remember, you have to make up for using the wrong-shaped pot as well). A full three packets for a quart of liquid gives it the body and crust I'm looking for. </div><div> In order to get a cassoulet that stays nice and loose underneath while still building a crust up top, it's important not to drown that crust out. If your liquid level starts to get too low, add more liquid (plain water works) to the pot by carefully pouring it along the side of the pot so that it goes <em>under</em> the crust, not over it. </div><div> Break into the cassoulet's crust, and underneath, you've got creamy, flavor-packed beans with meltingly tender nubs of pork belly, sausage, and chicken legs that fall off the bone in moist shreds, all in a rich, sticky liquid that drinks like liquid pork. </div><div><br>Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt</div><div> This is the kind of fare that demands you sit down and make an event out of it, good Languedoc wine and all. </div><div> It's the kind of meal so rich and hearty that all you could possibly eat on the side is a <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/simple-vinaigrette\">simple green salad (preferably with an excellent French vinaigrette)</a>. </div><div> I mean, just look at it! </div><div><br>Serious Eats / J.
