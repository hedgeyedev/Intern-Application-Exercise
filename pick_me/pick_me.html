        <h4>Why Canada?</h4>
        <p>I am a dual citizen of the US and Canada, so I get the "Canadian" tuition rate. It's about $4,000 CAD a semester, and usually my rent ends up costing more than tuition.</p>

        <p>I was born and raised in Connecticut, and am a US citizen. 100% authorized to work, and I can provide proof of citizenship.</p>
        <h4>Why are you leaving BeyondTrust?</h4>
        <p>I've really enjoyed my time at BeyondTrust, and while they would keep me another summer, I want diverse experiences. This is the one time in life where I can work somewhere for four months, and nobody questions it later on!</p>
        <h4>Why do you want to come back to the US?</h4>
        <p>My family lives in Connecticut and I'd like to spend some time with them. I also miss Target, and other American conviniences like single stream recycling, and free speech.</p>
