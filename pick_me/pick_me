The existence of this letter may be evidently displaying it already, but I’m highly interested in Hedgeye Risk Management summer internship as a developer.But you might feel that every applicant is smart and has “leadership, communication and interpersonal skills” right? Well, I believe that my ability to adapt and excel in a dynamic progressive environment is what truly sets me apart. I am all about learning. I ask for help when I get stuck. As I was doing the internship application exercise I had no idea about Ruby on Rails but I went through all the hurdle and figured it out. I also found a bug in the application exercise. There was some issues due to incompatible version of rails. I beieve in the idea of being productively lost and I enjoy divign into new areas of computing.
Currently, I work as the Web Designer for Berea College Craft department, which let me practice my front end development skills. Although I have never had a web designing class, I was able to teach myself to manage this website. In this position, I hold complete responsibility of working on the website under minimum supervision. This means that no matter how crazy it drives me to split my time between the heavy workload of my double major, responsibilities of my two jobs and engagement in extracurricular activities, I can sleep in peace if, and only if, I get it all done perfectly. Additionally, this job requires me to be ready in a shining armor to win any battle against unexpected changes. As I am the only tech person available at my work place, I have to be there to fix problems even if the projector stops working. I believe that my ability to welcome change with open arms and come up with innovative solutions spontaneously will be recognized as valuable at The Hedgeye Risk Management.
