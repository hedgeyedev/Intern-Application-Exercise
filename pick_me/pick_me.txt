I am John Sweeney, an organized, driven computer science student with a passion for learning. Pick me because I’ve spent two years writing Java programs which leverage object-oriented programming to it’s full potential. Pick me because I have a love for web applications for their accessibility, unique position of compatibility, and their ever-evolving world of frameworks and languages. Each month I discover another tool to leverage which makes my development process more clean and streamlined, and at the same time, more powerful. This is unparalleled by other fields of programming. Pick me because I have extensive experience with HTTP, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, PHP, Apache, NGINX, SQL, MongoDB, Meteor.js, Jade/Pug, stylus, and Express.js. Pick me because I can deploy anything, anywhere, and keep it running. Ever since I discovered my fervor for programming, I’ve hooked up my projects to the internet, no matter the circumstances. This has led me to build up a valuable trove of knowledge in deployment and cloud computing. I’ve faced many different situations, and created unique setups for each. Pick me because I’ve managed and built-up large databases using SQL, then optimized, and dynamically delivered data from them. Pick me because I love Linux, and work on many different Linux servers each day, quickly and efficiently navigating the OS and it’s command line. Pick me because I love to use Photoshop to craft original logos and designs, and implement them in my projects. Pick me because testing is important, and I can generate test sets, reduce errors to specific tests, and keep edge-cases in check. Most importantly, pick me because I care about my work. Pick me because I’m organized and efficient. Pick me because I’m never satisfied until my code is designed as optimally as possible, and functions as quickly as possible. Finally, pick me because my resourcefulness is one of my greatest strengths; there isn’t anything I can’t research.

This internship is of extreme interest to me because the web is something I’ve fallen in love with. I haven’t found this kind of passion in any other area of computer science because there is no area of computer science so uniquely situated to reach the entire globe. I love discovering new web technologies, and testing them to their limits to find each one’s ideal use case. I recently began using Meteor, and I loved it, so I built a social news app with it. What a pleasure that was to create, however, translating my website to Meteor made me realize Meteor’s failures when it comes to routing and static site delivery. This internship would mean that I could explore new technologies, and have the chance to work hands-on in a production web environment. I’m very interested because I would love the opportunity to collaborate with other developers who share a similar passion for technology and working with web technologies.

Thank you for your time.
