Hello, I'm Michael Trueba.

I am a very organized and goal-oriented developer. Although, I am a student I use Python almost everyday for various programming assignments and sometimes personal projects.
I've only ever published hackathon projects, but through them I've developed a very efficient workflow, that would be valuable in a production environment, over the past few years.
I discovered Rails roughly a year ago and I've been using it alongside Django ever since.
The level of automation in Rails makes it my preferred framework for meeting deadlines.

I've always had an interest in the synergy between financial markets and technology.
Hedgeye appears to be a company that is leveraging technology to the fullest extent to gain insight into financial markets.
To me, that is very exciting. After I complete the classes for my degree in computer science this semester I plan to pursue a second major in economics.

Thanks for your time and consideration.  --Also thanks for the programming exercise, it's a nice way to let applicants showcase their talent.
