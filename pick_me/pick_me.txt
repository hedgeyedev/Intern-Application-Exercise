University of Minnesota, Twin Cities 
Major : Computer Science
GPA   : 3.95

I have decent experience in C/C++, Java and C# and basic knowledge of other languages. 

I'm a extremely fast and eager learner who adapts well to new methods and procedures. 

I'm having a quite idle semester and self-learning everything about web developing.

I can start working remotely or learning anything essential for the internship immediately.

I'm very intereted not only because of the internship itself, but also because of the
brilliantly-designed application exercise.

My resume (both txt and pdf) is uploaded in the same directory and I really look 
forward to speaking with you sometime.
