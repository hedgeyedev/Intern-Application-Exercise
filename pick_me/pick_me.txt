    You should pick me for the Developer Intern (Dana Point) position because I’m
an independent, curious, and diligent student who enjoys working with others to
ship high-quality code. I am currently a senior at the University of Washington
Tacoma and this June I will be graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Computer
Science, with a minor in Mathematics. I have been passionate about technology
and coding ever since I was a child. Over the years I have coded in many
different languages (C, Python, Java, JavaScript, VB.NET, Assembly), but my
favorite two are Java and JavaScript. I had never tried Ruby or Ruby on Rails
before, but I thoroughly enjoyed my time with them over the course of this
exercise. I found it fairly interesting to see classic object-oriented
principles being applied to web development. I am familiar with TDD, but am not
as well-versed with the process as I would like to be; I see this position as a
good opportunity to improve those skills. On the other hand, I have had multiple
experiences with Agile software development. These experiences included weekly
meetings, incremental development, prioritized user stories, etc., etc. The
latest experience involved building an Android application that used PHP to
read and write to a MySQL database. I am currently enrolled in a databases
course, where I hope to learn how to expertly design relational databases.
Through my years of experience I have often encountered Linux, but I have never
heard of Nix or NixOS before, though I have often used the APT and yum package
managers. I have some experience designing user interfaces for my programs, and
am versed in Photoshop (and Illustrator), but I would not call myself a designer.

    Regarding the required proficiencies, I consider that my extensive experience
with coding adequately fulfills the programming requirement. I strongly believe
that my diverse knowledge will allow me to rapidly pick up and excel at Ruby on
Rails development. The web development proficiency is a little more problematic.
I have developed web apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (sometimes with a
little jQuery), but have minimal experience shipping such code into production.
However, I surpass the testing proficiency requirement due to my comprehension
of practical software testing. I have often written unit tests for projects (and
GUI tests on one occasion), and I’ve spent this whole year grading other
people’s code. This involved studying and testing 35 students’ code submissions
on 4-6 occasions a quarter (3 quarters total). Due to these competencies, I
firmly feel that I am in a strong position to quickly adapt and begin positively
contributing to Hedgeye.

Sincerely,

Vlad

P.S. I have family in Irvine, so relocation would be trivial.
