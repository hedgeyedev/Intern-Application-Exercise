Dear Forrest Chang:

I am a graduate student at the Northeastern University, pursuing Masters of Science in Computer Science. I have passion for building web applications and currently learning the MEAN stack for web development. I am always curious to learn new technologies, for example before this challenge I had no experience with the Rails framework, but I learned it and enjoyed doing the challenge. Also beacuse of my previous exprience with other frameworks like AngularJs and MVC architecture I could easily understand most of the things quickly and rapidly develop the required components.

I worked as a web developer trainee in the Open Source technology team with Icreon Communications. As a part of the team, I developed strong understanding about recent trends in web development such as Responsive Web Design, Sass and other frameworks like Bootstrap. I also contributed on theming for existing websites developed in Drupal and WordPress. With an opportunity to work on a Hybrid Mobile Application as freelance developer I learnt more about technologies like Ionic Framework and AngularJs.

I believe my work experience and current education have prepared me well for the requirements of the job. I have strong work ethics and leadership skills and hence I feel I would be an ideal candidate for the position of summer intern. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Regards, 
Bhupendra Singh
