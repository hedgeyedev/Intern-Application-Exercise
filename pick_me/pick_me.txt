I should be picked for this internship because I have an aptitude for communicating well with ohers and working together 
to achieve a common goal. Additionally I'm well versed in concepts of object-oriented programming concepts, I'm passionate
about computer science and technology. I enjoy coding just as much as any other hobby. I'm interested in agile development. 
I have experience with databases and mobile technology. And lastly, I can often do better than programmer graphics.
I'm interested in the internship because I've also had an interest for financial markets and finTech in general so I see Hedgeye
as a good opportunity to learn more about two areas I'm interested in, web development and finTech.
