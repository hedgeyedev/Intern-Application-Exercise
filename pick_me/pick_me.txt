Hello! Thanks for taking the time to look over my version of your exercise and
consider me for this job. I feel that I am already well-qualified for the
position as a Developer Intern in Stamford, and think that my passion to learn
more about web programming will drive me to become an even better employee as
the summer progresses.

I'm currently a sophomore at Tufts University studying Computer Science and
Math. I've done a variety of things that prepare me well for the internship,
from classes to side projects. I have enough experience with C++ and Java,
mostly through classes, to be well-versed in object-oriented programming. I
have also had to work in groups or pairs, whether it has been during a hackathon
or during a project, so feel that my communication skills are excellent.

I am also very familiar with bugfixes and an extensive amount of testing through
a Machine Structures and Programming course I took last semester. Many of the
projects required very careful testing and debugging, which has turned into
regular practice for me.

My motivation helps me stand out: I taught myself web programming languages
during high school to create a small (local) website, and have continued coding
with these languages in college, as you can see in the Water Irrigation project
on my github, which was done in a 20 hour span at a hackathon. This motivation
serves me well, as even with no experience with Ruby on Rails beforehand, once
I began editing the blog given to me, I started to enjoy it and picked it up
very quickly. Unfortunately, I'm applying to this job in the middle of finals,
so don't have much time to work on the blog, but I'm sure I'll do more once
time permits.

Thank you again for considering me for this position. I hope you agree that I
am a good fit for this job, and hope to hear from you soon.

Best,
Andrew Savage
