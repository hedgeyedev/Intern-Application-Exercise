I am currently an upcoming 4th year student, majoring in Computer Science at the University of California Santa Cruz where I’ll be graduating in 2020, and saw Hedgeye's intern ad. I'm really interested in how Hedgeye as a company in the field of online financial media leverages technology to it's advantage. Aside from really enjoying learning about programming, I really enjoy learning about the topic of finance and since Hedgeye is operating with relation to this niche, I would be extremely interested in the work involved; since I get to learn professional web development and finance.

I believe I have enough relevant technical skills from the material I’ve learned from inside the classroom, and from the material I’ve learned on my own for the past 3 years to be a strong asset and contributor to a team; but also, if there is anything I don’t know or understand, I will go out of my way to change that.  I also believe I have a strong ability to reason and think logically in finding a solution to a problem, having taken many computer science courses and mathematics courses that required me to do so. 

Aside from school, I’m currently volunteering my time at my school’s annual hackathon Cruzhacks where I’ll be working as a student software engineer developing the landing page and other utilities for the event. This experience is teaching me proper programming standards, in depth of full stack web development using the MERN stack, and also teamwork and collaborating with other students in this organization.  In addition, it’s extremely fun seeing your team’s vision and ideas come to life, and it’s something I am grateful to be apart of. I hope I can apply my passion in programming and eventually become an integral intern to your organization.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
