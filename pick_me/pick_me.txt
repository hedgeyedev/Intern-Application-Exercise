Dear Hedgeye Team,

	I am applying for the position of Developer Intern. I learned of this position through glassdoor.com. This position stood out 
  to me, because I am very interested in web development, and have recently begun teaching myself HTML and CSS. I also have 
  experience using object oriented programming with C# and C++. I recently graduated from Sacred Heart University with a BS in 
  Computer Science. During my studies, I took several classes that combined aspects of programming and software engineering. 

	As a senior, myself along with my partner were required to spend the year designing and developing a video game, using 
  self-taught tools and programs. We started off by creating documentation, such as data flow diagrams, event tables, and modules, 
  and then implemented features into the game itself. We were required to update our professors on our progress according to a 
  project schedule. We needed to regularly adapt our game to changing variables such as time, user feedback during testing, or 
  simply coming up with stronger ideas. While developing the game, it was immensely satisfying to bounce ideas off my partner, 
  and come up with something to work on together. The dynamic nature of this type of work appeals greatly to me.

	I also gained valuable work experience at Sacred Heart. For nearly two years, I worked in Sacred Heartâ€™s IT department, 
  performing front desk, call center, and onsite support. I regularly encountered clients who were having problems I had never 
  seen before, and would need to analyze the situation, and identify solutions either on my own, or by working together with my 
  co-workers. Multi-tasking and prioritizing important issues over minor ones were large aspects of the job. 

	I believe that my positive attitude, experience, and passion for technology solutions makes me a strong candidate for 
  this position. My skills and abilities will help support Hedgeye in the independent investment research business. 


Sincerely, 
Scott Zoba
