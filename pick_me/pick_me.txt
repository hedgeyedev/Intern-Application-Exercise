Hi,

I am Shrutika !!!

I am applying for software engineer internship with Hedgeye. I learned about the internship through a job portal.

I am currently pursuing Masters of Science in Computer Science at Indiana University Bloomington and will graduate in May, 2014. While I have a comprehensive software engineering background, my emphasis is on Data Analysis, Machine Learning & Web Development projects as my skills and interests stand on Machine Learning.


I previously worked part time for a startup organization, Foodies Compass in India where I held the position of a Business Researcher. During my stint with Foodies Compass, I used Java to develop web crawlers and extract data from competitors. I used this data to study the current trends and predict the most popular food items for the firm. With this experience I developed a liking towards data mining and machine learning algorithms.I have also worked for a Non-Profit organization wherein I developed a website using php, Non Profit Organization, SWAMEE, for which developed a website using php, javascript, html, CSS and MySql. I also developed a website “Event Spotting” for database class using the same technologies.

Last semester in my graduate level Artificial intelligence course, we used Python for our projects, and it was arguably the most fun class I have taken.  One of the major motivators for any developer is knowing that his or her code is being used by users and is providing unique experiences for them that would otherwise not have existed. While this might sound cliche, the truth of the matter is that many great and talented developers, both in industry and academia, write great code which unfortunately never sees the light of a decent sized user base. 

Currently, I am also involved with a start up Tourize as the co-founder. We started with the startup at the Bloomington StartUp Weekend where we won the first place. I work with Tourize as the Developer.

I would like an opportunity to discuss with you about the job profile. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to see any work samples.

Thank You for your time.

Sincerely,
Shrutika Poyrekar
