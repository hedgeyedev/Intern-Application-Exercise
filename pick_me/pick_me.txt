I'm a graduate student from the University of Minnesota with a Computer Science major.

I have solid experience in multiple programming languages such as C/C++, Java and C#.

I'm a extremely fast and eager learner who adapts well to new methods and procedures. 

I'm having a quite idle semester. I'm self-learning everything about web developing 
and I'm willing to learn anything that is required for the internship. 

I'm very intereted not only because of the internship itself, but also because of the
application exercise you guys designed. It's brilliant!

I look forward to speaking with you sometime.
