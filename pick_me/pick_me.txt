I am a full-time student at the University of Rochester majoring in computer sciences and I believe that my enthusiasm and knowledge in computer programing would make me a good candidate for this internship. Since, I am completing a web programming course, I am very excited to apply my theoretical knowledge to work in a professional environment.

I have always enjoyed mathematics and computers. Since I attended MathPath, an elite camp for math students who wanted to learn more mathematics, in 2008 I have been set on studying applied mathematics. I led a math-team as a captain for three years at Hamden High School and organized a Math SAT prep course there for students who needed help with the math section. Then, when I first came upon computer programming, I knew I wanted to write a code. At Rochester, I have become a dean's list student and enjoy working with other computer scientists on projects together. During my studies, I have encountered new languages and different types of code, which taught me to be very resourceful when it comes to learning new topics.

It will be a great opportunity for me to work at Hedgeye as an intern during the summer. I am planning to double major in Computer Science and Economics. Thus, I am looking forward for internship that would provide insights into these two areas. Another reason why this internship is so appealing to me is its location. Since I live in Hamden, I could easily commute to New Haven and be able to live at home with my family.

I would like to thank you for your time and consideration,
Dmitri Ostapenko
