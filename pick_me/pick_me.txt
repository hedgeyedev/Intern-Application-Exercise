Dear Mr. Forest Chang, 

Two months ago I succeeded to accomplish something few have been able to go through: graduating from an intensive six-month bootcamp 
while taking care of a toddler full-time. 
This statement may seem funny at first, but in order to do so I coded eight hours a day, taking advantage of any naptime and time where 
my husband could watch our son. 
My training shedule often went into the late hours of the night. I knew it was worth every sacrifice. 
I am passionate with Ruby on Rails; every hour spent on a project makes me want to spend another one on it. 

I take pride in making applications solving needs and problems I encounter. 
For example, I realized that too often I would be halfway through a movie when I remembered having already seen the movie and that I 
didn't like it.  
So I created an application to keep track of movies I have already seen and those I want to see. 
Currently I am working on a management tool my husband could benefit at work to organize his team around projects.

I take every project seriously, developing it to the point where I would feel comfortable to propose this tool for anyone to use. This means I am working toward filling up the main functions of the tool, the security aspect of the application and, of course, a pleasant 
user experience. 

Today I am hoping to bring a valuable contribution to a team of other passionate developers. 
So if your company is looking to for a realiable junior developer with a strong team spirit to add to their software development team, I would be a great fit in your environment. 

Knowing you and Mr. Scott Smith for 2 years in the context of our Ruby meetups, I can see your expertise on the subjects we discuss and really would like the opportunity to learn from your experience.

Looking forward to working on your biggest challenges with dedication, 

Lizzie Sorin,
