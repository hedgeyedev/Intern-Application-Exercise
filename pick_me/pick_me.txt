While looking for the internship I came across your posting on internships.com and it got me really interested. 
In your posting you mentioned that you would like your intern to have experience working with database, skilled in web development and programming. I believe I satisfy your requirements and would like to give it try!

Currently I work as a database developer at B507 (www.b507.us) where my primary project was to build custom database application for the client in Filemaker Pro. I have passed an Oracle certification for the SQL Fundamentals, widely used SQL Server, MySQL and SQLite. 

Even though I really like working with databases, most of all I enjoy web and mobile application development.  I have created several native and hybrid applications for Android and now starting to work on iOS application which I plan to finish by end of August. My web development skills include Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP and Ruby on Rails. The most favorite ones are RoR and Javascript. I've created a simple card game in Javascript and now working on the application in Ruby on Rails.

Your internship is interesting to me bacause I really enjoy deloping in Ruby on Rails and follow agile methodology in software development. I could bring my strong knowledge of database and mobile development and gain experience with RoR. Also I live really close to your Stamford office and I am eligible to work in USA. 

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to meeting with you in person to discuss further details about the position and my qualifications. Please feel free to contact me if you require further information or would like to schedule an interview.
