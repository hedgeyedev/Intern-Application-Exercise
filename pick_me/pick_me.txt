Dear Hiring Manager,

After graduating with a degree in Music and spending a year teaching English in Japan, I have honed in on what I want to do professionally. Initially, my long term goal was to become a Linux system administrator, so I became A+ certified and got an entry level IT job. I started looking into Bash scripting. I ended up finding this type of problem solving very enjoyable and eventually my goal shifted from wanting to be a Linux system administrator to wanting to be a programmer.

I started working through The Odin Project, an open source coding curriculum.  After a year, I have created applications purely with Ruby on Rails and I have created applications using Rails as an API with a ReactJS frontend. I am ready to get some real world experience and an internship with Hedgeye seems like it would help me improve my abilities as a web developer.

Here are some of the skills I possess that would allow me to contribute to your organization:

Ruby on Rails development
ReactJS Development
Vanilla Javascript
JWT Authentication
Version control with Git
Competent on Linux machines

If you go to https://lucas-odonnell.github.io/lucas-odonnell-website/ you can see a few of my sample projects. I can be reached anytime at (415) 539 6186 or at lucas.odonnelll@gmail.com.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity. 

Sincerely,
Lucas Oâ€™Donnell
