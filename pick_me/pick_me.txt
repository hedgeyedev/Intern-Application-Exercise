Hi everyone

My name is Lucas Trombeta.
I am hard-working, a quick learner, and I am highly adaptable. 
I have experience in working with coding and design databases, 
as well as improving features in apllications(plugins). 
Also, I like to work in group teams, specially with people that are 
available to learn and teach each other. 
Unfortunately my project is not finished, but if you analyse the code 
you will see that I tried to do something different as login with
facebook for comments. This integration is working, unfortunately I have
no more time this week to spend in this project to rearranje the views 
and create a beautiful design, once I am a student and I have some projects
to bring back this week. But I believe if you analyse it, you will see that 
I have knowledge in coding in ruby and I am highly motivated to learn more
and help your team as a developer: coding, giving ideas, sharing experiences.

Have a nice week
