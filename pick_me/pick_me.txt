Hello, 

my name is Amedeo D'Ascanio and I would like to be considered for a position at Hedgeye. Before explaining you why you should pick me, I would like to tell you why you would not select me:

- I am applying to be considered for a training position participating in the Professional Career Training program (http://j1visa.state.gov/programs/trainee or http://www.interexchange.org/career-training-usa/hire-intern-trainee), so maybe this is not a good option for you.
- I am not a ruby developer: I have used ruby on rails for the first time doing this exercise.
- I am currently not in US; Visa sponsorship can be easily provieded through the above mentioned program, though.

So, why you would ever think of considering my profile?
I have already some experience in web development: 
- I am a UI software engineer at Amadeus, in France, with responsibilities on the eretail product which provides the standard booking flows for fligths, cars and hotels for many airline companies. 
- Besides delivering new features and performing maintenance activities, I am now involved in several activities to improve customization, usability and accessibility for people with disabilities. 
- In doing these tasks I have been using mainly javascript and js frameworks, (x)html, css, Java, jsp.
- Before being at Amadeus I had worked at United Nations' agency FAO in Rome as Java web developer. At FAO I had to work on the full stack (front-end, back-end and database development) of an internal Information System.

After getting my Masters Degree in Computer Engineering in Italy, defending a thesis carried out at the University of California, Irvine, I have started to look at the possibility of participating in the Professional Career Training in order to gain a considerable experience working in an American company. A position at Hedgeye seems a great opportunity to achieve this goal.

I hope that my profile could be somehow suitable for this position or any other opening you might have available in your company.

Thank you for your time in considering my application.

Sincerely

Amedeo D'Ascanio
