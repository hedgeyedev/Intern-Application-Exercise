To the members of Hedgeye Risk Management,

I am writing in response to my potential candidacy as a Web Developer Intern for your team. 

I would like to express my interest in this responsibility; I feel that I can assist in this position to not only meet the responsibilities outlined to me, but also assist in making your website more attractive to potential individuals, professionals, and institutions. My interest in this position is twofold. First, I am a current college Junior seeking to gain experience as a web developer, and your internship impressed me greatly. Second, as I will be graduating next year, I am looking to gain personal finance experience that your business clearly exceeds in. 

I look forward to hearing from you and responding to any questions regarding my ability to serve in this capacity. 

Sincerely

Charles C. Severson
