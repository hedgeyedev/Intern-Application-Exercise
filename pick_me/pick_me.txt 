Why should you pick me?

I noticed on your website that "It’s not business as usual. It’s definitely different here."

I am not your typical intern candidate. I have a career in back of me and have developed an interest in the technological side of things. To that end, I enrolled in a Web Development Intensive program which I completed in April. Since then, I have been working on my portfolio, developing new projects and continue to learn new things. It's fun and I like it and want to continue developing professionally in this area. This internship would enable me to do that. In return you get someone who has an ability to pick up new things quickly and who hits all the skills required and pluses listed on your website for this position. 

For the blog, I focused on styling the Index page as my portfolio shows my Ruby on Rails skills. Thank you for considering me for this position.


I am enclosing a copy of my resume, my LinkedIn page and a link to my portfolio.
