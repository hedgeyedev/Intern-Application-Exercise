# Instructions
   * Add a file pick_me.txt which describes why we should choose you as an intern.  It would be nice to stand out, but a fallback would be typical cover letter type verbiage.  Include why you think our internship is interesting to you.
   * (Optional) Anything else you want us to know, resume, portfolio, etc. is appropriate.
